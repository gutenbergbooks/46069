      FOREWORD
    </h2>
    <p>
      Quis funera faudo Explicet, aut possit lacrymis aequare Labores? Urbs
      antiqua ruit, fnultos dominât a per annos; Plurima perque vias sternuntur
      inertia passim. Corpora, perque domos, et religiosa deorum Limina!
    </p>
    <p>
      (Virgil, Æneid, II. v. 361.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Surviving the ancient wars and revolutions in this, "the Cockpit of
      Europe," the great examples of architecture of the early days of France
      remained for our delight. The corroding fingers of time, it is true, were
      much more merciful to them, but certainly the destroyers of old never
      ventured to commit the crimes upon them now charged against the legions of
      the present invader. These fair towns of Picardy and Champagne are sacked,
      pillaged and burned even as were the beautiful Flemish towns of Ypres,
      Malines, Termonde, Dixmude, and Dinant on the Meuse....
    </p>
    <p>
      Never again shall we enjoy them: the chalices are broken and the perfume
      forever vanished....
    </p>
    <p>
      The catastrophe is so unbelievable that one cannot realize it. The Seven
      Churches of Soissons, Senlis, Noyon, Laon, Meaux, Rheims, St. Remi; these
      such as man probably never again can match, are either razed to the
      foundations, or so shattered that it will be impossible to restore them.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is said that the Imperial Government has promised to rebuild these
      Gothic masterpieces....
    </p>
    <p>
      One cannot trust one's self to comment upon this announcement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Imagine these sacred ruins.... Rheims!... Rheims can never be restored to
      what it was before the bombardment. Let it rest thus.... A sacred ruin&mdash;the
      scarred, pierced heart of France!
    </p>
    <p>
      Likewise "these fair sweet towns" of the middle ages; these wonderful
      little streets and byways, filled with the gray old timbered houses, "old
      in Shakespeare's day." Up to the outbreak of the war there were many of
      these throughout France, in spite of the wave of modernity which resulted
      in so much so called town improvement.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Arras the two old Squares, the Grand Place and the Petit Place,
      survived until destroyed by bombs in 1914. Those double rows of Ancient
      Flemish gables, and the beautiful lace like tower of the Town Hall cannot
      be forgotten, although they are now but calcined beams and ashes. Between
      the Seine and the Flemish frontier lay a veritable storehouse of
      incomparable architectural monuments. Of these Rouen, with its famous
      Cathedral, is happily out of reach of the guns of the invader, and one
      hopes out of danger. Beauvais likewise has not yet suffered, nor Chalons,
      with its great church of St. Loup and St. Jean, but the Cathedral and the
      town of Noyon have been leveled, and the gray walls of incomparable
      coucy-le-Château, "that greatest of the castles of the Middle Ages," whose
      lords arrogantly proclaimed "Roi ne suys, ne prince, ne duc, ne conte
      aussi; je suys le Sire de Coucy," have vanished forever from the heights
      under the wanton fire of the invaders' shells, and twenty thousand pounds
      of powder placed in the walls and exploded in revenge on the day of the
      retreat (April 1917).
    </p>
    <p>
      Amiens, for some reason, has been spared, but it too may yet receive its
      baptism of fire, even as Rheims. Amiens and Rheims! Never were there such
      miracles of art as shown in these temples! Rheims is now a ragged ruin of
      roofless leaning walls. So Amiens, miraculously preserved, is now the
      greatest existing example of Christian architecture in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the following chapters I have quoted extracts from accounts written by
      eyewitnesses of acts committed by the invader in the devastated towns of
      France. I am not responsible for these statements, nor can I vouch
      absolutely for their truth, or correctness. I give them for what they are
      worth as part of the setting&mdash;the frame work of the pictures I have
      made of the noble, now vanished monuments which can never be replaced....
    </p>
    <p>
      If I have betrayed bitter feeling it is because of their destruction by
      whomsoever accomplished.

    <h2>
      ARRAS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t was half-past
      six o'clock on a summer's morning, and a deep-toned bell in the cathedral
      sounded over the quaint gables of this really Flemish city of Arras.
      Although we were in France, little difference either in the people,
      costumes or architecture could be noted, so mingled here were the
      characteristics of the French and the Belgians. The sun was well up and
      gleamed hotly upon the old roof tops of the town, old many of them in
      Shakespeare's day, and flooded with golden light the quaint market place,
      now filled with swarming peasants. There were great heaps of flowers here
      and there, among the booths containing varied merchandise, and some of the
      market people were taking their morning bowls of hot <i>café au lait</i>,
      made fresh in green and yellow earthenware "biggins," over small iron
      braziers containing burning charcoal. The odor was inviting, and as the
      people are always kindly disposed towards the traveler who has <i>savoir
      faire</i>, one may enjoy a fragrant and nourishing bowl with them in
      profitable and friendly commune, for almost whatever he chooses to offer,
      and not rarely free of any fee whatever save a "thank you," which is
      always received with a gracious smile and a murmured "<i>N'pas d'quoi,
      M'sieu</i>," or an "<i>Au plaisir</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was perchance a market morning in Arras, and the long open square lined
      on either hand with strangely gabled Flemish houses, and closed at the
      upper end by the admirable lofty towered Town Hall, was filling fast with
      arrivals from the country round about.
    </p>

    <p>
      Everything was fresh and clean from the late rains, and the air was laden
      with the mingled perfume of flowers; with butter and cheese. Country carts
      of extravagant design and painted green were unloading, and the farmer's
      boys were fitting together the booths for the sale of their varied
      commodities. Here and there were active dark complexioned Hebraic looking
      men and women, hard faced and sinister, who presided over stalls for the
      sale of cloth, shoes and the trinkets of small value calculated to tempt
      the peasantry. A cinematograph booth, resplendent with gilding, mirrors,
      and red and white paint, towered over the canvas covered booths, and a
      "merry go round," somewhat shabby by contrast, stood near it, its motive
      power, a small fat horse, contentedly eating his breakfast out of a brass
      hooped pail. The shops were opening one by one, displaying agricultural
      tools, and useful articles desired by the peasants. One heard bargaining
      going on, sometimes in the Flemish tongue, proving how near we were to
      Flanders, and sometimes in Walloon. Both tongues are used here, and the
      costumes partake of their characteristics, the women in neat if coarse
      stuffs, and the men in stiff blue blouses, usually in wooden shoes, too.
      This was remarkable, for the wooden shoe was fast vanishing from the
      towns. We noted too, that women were abandoning the snowy white lace
      trimmed caps once forming such a quaint feature of market day gatherings.
      Now various hideous forms of black and purple bonnets, decked out with
      beads and upstanding feathers disfigured them, but with what pride they
      were worn!
    </p>
    <p>
      This market place at Arras was a sight worth a long journey to witness, if
      but to see the display of animals, chickens, and flowers on a bright sunny
      morning in the square beneath the tower of the Town Hall. The fowls
      squawked and flapped their wings; dogs barked; horses neighed; and hoarse
      voiced vendors called out their bargains. Here and there the fowl were
      killed on the spot for the buyer, and carried off by rosy cheeked
      unsentimental housewives, carried off, too, often hidden in bunches of
      bright flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Did I write unsentimental?&mdash;An error. Nowhere were the common people
      more given to sentiment. Does not one remember the large room that la
      belle madame at the 'Couronne d'or provided for the traveling painter, who
      occupied it for two weeks, and during the season too, and when he
      discovered on the morning of departure that it was not included in the
      bill, on pointing out the omission to madame, did she not, and with the
      most charming smile imaginable say, with a wave of her shapely brown hands&mdash;"One
      could not charge for a room used as M'sieur's studio. The honor is
      sufficient to the 'Couronne d'or." And how to repay such kindness?
    </p>
    <p>
      In an hour the noise and chattering of a market morning was in full sway.
      And over all sounded the great bell of the Cathedral: other church bells
      joined in the clamor, and at once began an accompaniment of clattering
      wooden shoes over the rough cobbles towards the church doors. Following
      these people up the street, we entered the dim pillared nave of the old
      church. On Sundays and market days the interior formed a picture not to be
      forgotten, and one especially full of human interest. The nave was freer
      of modern "improvements" than most of the churches, and there was much
      quiet dignity in the service. A large number of confessional cabinets,
      some of very quaint and others of most exquisitely carved details, were
      set against the walls. Some of these had heavy green baize curtains to
      screen them instead of doors, and some of the cabinets were in use, for
      the skirt of a dress was visible below one of the curtains. The women
      before the altar knelt on the rush seats of small chairs, resting their
      clasped hands, holding rosaries, on the back, furnished with a narrow
      shelf between the uprights. They wore dark blue or brown stuff dresses,
      and small plaid shawls. We noted that not one of these wore wooden shoes
      or sabots. All on the contrary wore neat leather shoes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The women, especially the older ones, all turned their heads and curiously
      examined us as we tip-toed about, without, however, interrupting their
      incessant prayers for an instant. And they did not seem to resent our
      presence in the church, or regard it as an intrusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the subdued colored light from the painted windows, with the clouds of
      incense rising, the proportions of the columns and the lancet arches and
      windows were most impressive, and together with the kneeling peasants made
      a very fine effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      While there was little to be found in Arras that was really remarkable,
      for the town was given over to the traffic in grain and the townspeople
      were all very commercial, there were bits of the town corners and side
      streets worthy of recording. Near the dominating Town Hall were many types
      of ancient Flemish gabled houses, of which we shall not find better
      examples even in Flanders itself. Arras was as noisy as any Belgian market
      town where soldiers are stationed. There was the passing of heavy military
      carts through the ill-paved streets; the clatter of feet; the sounds of
      bugle and rolling of drum at sundown. The closing of the cafés at midnight
      ended the day, while at dawn in the morning the din of arriving and
      passing market wagons commenced again, followed by the workmen and women
      going to their daily tasks at the factories.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do these people never rest?" asked Lady Anne, whose morning nap was thus
      rudely interrupted. Ma-dame's answer came:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, indeed, yes. But not in the summer. Mark you, in the dark short days
      of winter, there is little going on in Arras. Then we are very quiet."

      The old town was old, very old. There were of course some modern looking
      white houses of stucco in which we were told some rich people live, and
      there were large blank walled factories with tall chimneys, from which
      heavy black smoke poured the livelong day. There were plate glass windows
      here and there, too, in some of the shops, with <i>articles de Paris</i>
      exposed for sale, and there were occasionally smooth pavements to be
      found, but mainly there were quaint old corners, high old yellow fronted,
      narrow windowed houses, and old, old men and older women passing to and
      fro in the narrow by streets.
    </p>
    <p>
      In one corner of the market place sat an ancient dame in a wonderful lace
      cap, who presided over a huge pile of pale green earthenware pots of
      various sizes and fine shapes, who all unconsciously made for me a picture
      in sunlight and shadow; brown wrinkled hands busy with knitting; brown
      wrinkled face and bright shrewd greeny blue eyes, twinkling below the
      flaps of her lace cap; all against a worn, old, rusty-hinged green door! I
      could not resist the opportunity. So in a convenient doorway I paused to
      make a note of it without attracting much attention from the passers-by.

      Entering the wide "place" (there were two of these) one was confronted by
      an astonishing vista of quaintly gabled Flemish houses on either hand, all
      built mainly after one model but presenting some variations of minor
      detail. These led to the Hotel de Ville. The houses were furnished with
      arcades below supported by monolithic sandstone columns. The Hotel de
      Ville, built in the sixteenth century (not a vestige of which remains at
      this writing, April, 1917), was one of the most ornate in France. Its fine
      Gothic façade rose upon seven quaintly different arcades, in the elaborate
      Renaissance style, pierced by ornate windows with Gothic tracery in the
      best of taste and workmanship. Overhead rose the graceful Belfry,
      terminating in a gilded ducal crown at the height of some two hundred and
      fifty feet. The weekly market fair was in full progress, and the old
      Grand' Place was swarming with carts, animals, booths, and chattering
      peasants. Before the Revolution, the Chapelle des Ardents and the spire of
      La Sainte-Chapelle on the Petit' Place commemorated the deliverance of
      Arras in the twelfth century from the plague called the "<i>mal des
      ardents</i>," when the Virgin is believed to have given a candle to two
      fiddlers, declaring that "water into which a drop of its holy wax had
      fallen would save all who drank it." *
    </p>
    <p>
      Behind the dominating tower of the Hotel de Ville was the modern
      Cathedral, formerly the abbey church of St. Vaast, with an unfinished
      tower of 1735.
    </p>
    <p>
      We found in the Chapel of the Virgin the tomb of Cardinal de la Tour d'
      Auvergne-Lauraguais, and the twelfth century tombs of an abbot, of
      Philippe de Torcy, a governor of Arras, and his wife. The treasury is said
      to have contained the blood-stained "<i>rochet</i>" worn by Thomas à
      Becket when he was murdered, but the sacristan refused to show it unless
      he was first paid a fee of two francs, which we thought exorbitant.

      Arras was the capital of the Gallic tribe "Atrebates," and even in the dim
      fourth century was famous for the manufacture of woolen cloth, dyed with
      the madder which grows luxuriously in the neighborhood. The wearing of
      tapestry hangings gave Arras a high reputation, and examples are preserved
      in the museums of France and England, where the name of the town is used
      to identify them. The art has long since ceased to exist, needless to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      Briefly, the town followed the fortunes of the Pays d' Artois, of which it
      was the capital, passing by marriage from the house of France to Burgundy,
      Flanders, Burgundy again, Germany and Spain. After the battle of
      Agincourt, the English and French signed the treaty of peace at Arras. The
      town was finally incorporated with France in 1640.

      which is said to have so enraged Louis of France that he expelled the
      whole population, abolishing even the name of Arras, which he changed to
      that of Franchise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here was born the great Robespierre, but we were unable to find the house,
      or even the street in which it was situated, nor could any of the
      ecclesiastics to whom we applied for information enlighten us in regard to
      the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cathedral, a romanesque structure, at an angle of the abbey buildings,
      and approached by high stone steps broken by a platform, was built in
      1755. Perhaps if we had not seen it after having feasted our eyes upon the
      exquisite details of the Hotel de Ville, it might have seemed more
      impressive and interesting. It contained some good pictures, including a
      "Descent from the Cross," and "The Entombment," attributed to Rubens and
      Van Dyck respectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      The high altar enshrined a notable bas-relief in gilt bronze. The Abbatial
      buildings were occupied by the 'Evéche, Seminary, Library, and the Musée,
      the latter containing a lot of modern paintings, badly hung, and seemingly
      indifferent in quality.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the cloisters, however, were rooms containing an archaeological
      collection of sculptures and architectural fragments, and a small
      collection of Flemish pictures by "Velvet" Breughel, Heemskerk, N. Maes
      and others, and upstairs, a fine model of an antique ship, "offered" by
      the States of Artois to the American Colonies in the War of Independence.
      One wonders why it was never sent.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of a quiet street which crossed the busy and crowded Rue St.
      Aubert, we came upon the remains of a remarkable old town gate, and the
      remains, too, of the ancient fortified walls, and farther on, the
      dismantled citadel constructed by the great Vauban in 1670, and called "La
      Belle Inutile." Here in this region, called the "cockpit of Europe," for
      ages incessant wars have been waged, covering the land with such a network
      of evidences of bitterly fought rivalries as no other portion of the earth
      can show, and when no foreign foe had to be baffled or beaten off, then
      the internecine wars of clan against clan have flooded the fair land with
      gore and ruin.
    </p>
    <p>
      But all was peaceful here about this old town this bright morning in July,
      1910. There was no evidence of the red waves of the wars which had rolled
      over and eddied about this very spot, save the old dismantled Vauban tower
      and the remains of the ancient wall, in which we were only mildly
      interested. It was the present day's wanderings which interested us more;
      the lives of the peasants, their customs and their daily occupations. Time
      seemed to stand still here without any consciousness of backwardness.
      Nothing hurried at Arras, and change for the sake of change had no
      attraction for it. The ways of the fathers were good enough for the
      children.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a newspaper here, of course, but yet the town crier held his
      own,&mdash;a strange looking old man in a long crinkly blue blouse,
      balloon like trousers of velveteen corduroy, wooden shoes and a broad
      brimmed felt hat. A drum hung suspended from his shoulder by a leather
      strap. He was followed by a small procession of boys and girls. He stopped
      and beat a vigorous tattoo on the drum; windows above and doors below were
      filled with heads as if by magic. He produced a folded paper from his
      pocket, glanced about him proudly conscious of the importance of the
      occasion, and read in a loud voice some local news of interest, and then
      announced the loss of something or other, with notice to hand whatever it
      was to the commissaire de Police, and then marched off down the street to
      repeat the performance at the next corner. The heads vanished from the
      windows like the cuckoos of German clocks, and the street was quiet again.
      Who could have believed that such a custom could have survived in the days
      of telegraph and telephone, and in a city of, say, thirty thousand
      inhabitants?
    </p>
    <p>
      The old streets and highways about the town were indescribably attractive,
      and beyond in the country, the shaded ways beneath large trees offered
      charming vistas, and shelter from the sun. The people seemed to have an
      intuitive feeling for harmony, and little or nothing in or about the
      cottages, save an occasional odoriferous pig sty, offended one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colors melted into half tones in the most seductive fashion, and there
      was, too, an insistent harmony in the costumes of the peasants, the stain
      of time on the buildings or the grayish greens of the landscape.
    </p>
    <p>
      But of all this the peasant was most certainly unconscious. The glories of
      nature and her marvelous harmonies were no more to him than to the beast
      of the field. He was hard of heart, brutal of tongue and mean of habit.
      Balzac has well described him in his "Sons of the Soil." Money was his
      god, and greed his pursuit. Yet all about him nature bloomed and
      fructified, while he toiled and schemed, his eyes ever bent earthwards.
      The peasant had no sentiment. It was best therefore to view him
      superficially, and as part of the picturesqueness of the country, like the
      roofs and gables of the old town, say, without seeking out secrets of the
      "menage" behind the walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were interested in the various occupations of these semi-Flemish
      peasants, and the cries of the vendors in the streets in the early
      morning. Most of these cries were unintelligible to us because of the
      mixed patois, but it amused us to identify the cry of the vendor of eels,
      which was most lugubrious&mdash;a veritable wail of distress, seemingly.
      And when we saw her in the street below our windows, laden with two heavy
      baskets containing her commodity, her fat rosy face lifted to the sky, her
      appearance so belied the agonizing wail that we laughed aloud&mdash;and
      then&mdash;she heard us! What vituperation did she not address to us? Such
      a vocabulary, too! although we did not understand more than a few words
      she made it very plain that she regarded us as most contemptible beings.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Miserable espece de Mathieux</i>" she called up to us again and again.
      Whatever that meant, whatever depths of infamy it denoted, we did not
      know, nor did we ever find out. We were much more careful thereafter, and
      kept away from the window, for setting down her baskets she planted
      herself on the curb opposite and there presiding over the curious group of
      market people whom she had collected about her, she raged and stormed with
      uplifted fat red arms gesticulating at our windows, until the crowd,
      wearying of her eloquence, gradually melted away. We never saw her again.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was also the seller of snails, whose cry was a series of ludicrous
      barks and cackles. I don't know how else to describe the extraordinary
      sounds he made. They quite fascinated us, for he varied them from time to
      time, taking seemingly much enjoyment in the ingenuity of his performance.
      His baskets, which hung by brass chains from a green painted yoke on his
      shoulders, contained a collection of very large snails, all, as he said,
      freshly boiled, and each shell being closed by a seal of fresh yellow
      butter, sprinkled, I think, with parsley (I never tasted them), and
      prettily reposing upon a bed of crisp pale green lettuce leaves. These
      seem to be highly esteemed by the people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our chief search in Arras, after valuing the ancient halls and the limited
      treasures of the museum, was for some examples of the wonderful tapestries
      known far and near by the name of "Arras." In vain we sought a specimen;
      there was none in the museum, nor in the town hall either. Those whom we
      thought might be able to assist us in our search professed ignorance of
      any such article, and the priest whom we met in the cathedral, directed us
      to the local furniture shop for what he called "<i>belle tapis</i>" So we
      gave it up, most reluctantly, however.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is strange that not one example could be found in the town of this most
      renowned tapestry, for this ancient town enjoyed a reputation second to
      none in the low countries for art work of the loom. Cloth and all manner
      of woolen stuffs were the principal articles of Flemish production, but it
      was chiefly from England that Flanders drew her supply of wool, the raw
      material of her industry, and England was her great market as early as the
      middle of the twelfth century. There was a great guild established in
      London called the Flemish "Hanse," to which the merchants sent their
      manufacture. It was governed by a burgher of Bruges who was styled "Count
      of the Hanse."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The merchants of Arras became so prosperous and powerful, that (says a
      chronicler), Marguerite II, called The Black, countess of Flanders and
      Hainault, 1244 to 1280, was extremely rich, not only in lands but
      furniture, jewels, and money; and, as is not customary with women, she was
      right liberal and right sumptuous, not alone in her largesses, but in her
      entertainments and whole manner of living; insomuch that she kept up the
      state of a queen rather than a countess." (Kervyn de Lettenhove, Histoire
      d' Flandre, t, ii. p. 300.)
    </p>
    <p>
      To Arras, in common with the neighboring towns, came for exchange the
      produce of the North and the South, the riches collected in the
      pilgrimages to Novogorod, and those brought over by caravans from
      Samarcand and Bagdad,&mdash;the pitch of Norway and oils of Andalusia, the
      furs of Russia and dates from the Atlas, the metals from Hungary and
      Bohemia, the figs of Granada, the honey of Portugal, the wax of Morocco
      and the spices from Egypt: "Whereby" says the ancient manuscript, "no land
      is to be compared in merchandise to this land."
    </p>
    <p>
      And so, even if the guide books do dismiss Arras at the end of a few curt
      details with the words "The Town is now given over to various
      manufactures, and its few attractions may be exhausted between trains,"
      Arras certainly did offer to the curious tourist many quaint vistas, a
      Town Hall of great architectural individuality, and in her two picturesque
      squares, the "Grand' Place" and the "Petit' Place," a picture of antiquity
      not surpassed by any other town in Northern France.

      Quoting that eminent architect, Mr. Ralph Adams Cram, "We may pause in
      spirit in Arras (it would not be well to be there now in body, unless one
      were a soldier in the army of the Allies, when it would be perilous, but
      touched with glory), for sight of an old, old city that gave a vision,
      better than almost any other in France, of what cities were in this region
      at the high-tide of the Renaissance. It is gone now, utterly,
      irremediably, and the ill work begun in the revolution and continued under
      the empire, when the great and splendid Gothic Cathedral was sold and
      destroyed, has been finished by Prussian shells.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Capital of Artois, it had a vivid and eventful history, continuing under
      Baldwin of the Iron Arm, who became the first Count of Arras; then being
      halved between the Count of Flanders and the King of France; given by St.
      Louis to his brother Robert, passing to the Counts of Burgundy, reverting
      to Louis de Male, of Flemish fame, abandoned to the Emperor, won back by
      France;... coming now to its end at the hands of the German hosts.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What Arras must have been before the Revolution we can only guess, but
      its glorious Cathedral, its Chappelle des Ardents, and its 'Pyramid of the
      Holy Candle' added to its surviving Town Hall, with its fantastically
      beautiful spire, and its miraculously preserved streets and squares lined
      with fancifully gabled and arcaded houses, it must have been a sanctuary
      of old delights. The Cathedral was of all styles from the twelfth to the
      sixteenth century, while the Chapel and the Pyramid were models of
      medieval art in its richest state. Both were destroyed by one Lebon, a
      human demon and an apostate priest, who organised a 'terror' of his own in
      his city, and has gone down to infamy for his pestilential crime. Both the
      destroyed monuments were votive offerings in gratitude to Our Lady for her
      miraculous intervention in the case of the fearful plague in the twelfth
      century, the instrument of preservation being a certain holy candle, the
      melted wax from which was effective in preserving the life of all it
      touched. The Pyramid was a slender Gothic tabernacle and spire, ninety
      feet high, standing in the 'Petit' Place,' a masterpiece of carved and
      gilded sculpture, unique of its kind. Every vestige has vanished,&mdash;Berlin
      has just announced that it has been completely and intentionally destroyed
      by gun-fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The fine vigor of the Renaissance and its life were gone with the color
      and gold of the carved and painted shrines and houses, the fanciful
      costumes, the alert civic life.&mdash;Wantonly destroyed!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Madeline Wartelle, a voluntary nurse, who was in Arras during the great
      bombardment in July, 1915, wrote in the volume "Les Cites Meurtries" the
      following account of her experiences during the destruction of the
      Cathedral and the other noble buildings.
    </p>
    <p>
      "On July 2d, about six o'clock in the evening several shells fell upon the
      Cathedral. Then followed a calm for two hours. At half past eight, a bomb
      dropped from above, set fire to the house of M. Daquin in the rue de'
      l'Arsenal, and in a few moments the flames were mounting to a great
      height. When the firemen (<i>pompiers</i>) arrived, the fire had already
      spread to the house of Mme. Cornnan, and could not be confined even to the
      neighboring ones. During and following this catastrophe, at one o'clock in
      the morning, an avalanche of great bombs, those called 'Marmites,' fell
      all over this quarter of the town. This time, alas, we had no trouble in
      getting all the details of the happening, for our house collapsed, being
      struck by the second bomb dropped by the 'Taube,' which went through the
      roof to the cellar. Luckily, we had gone to R&mdash;s when the fire broke
      out, and thus we all escaped.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Forced to leave (Arras) we did not see the demolishment of the Cathedral
      and the Palace of St. Vaast on Monday, July 5th, but I set down here what
      I have learned from the lips of a witness of the deplorable
      'aneantisment.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "From six o'clock on that date, the gun-fire of the 'Huns' was especially
      directed at the Cathedral, and the fire which ensued spread to the end of
      the Palace of St. Vaast, which contained the archives of the town, and
      which was entirely consumed, and spreading further likewise destroyed the
      Library and the Museum of the Seminary. The fire department did what it
      could to save the books and sacred objects, but their efforts were in
      vain, such was the rain of projectiles from the 'Taubes' above, and the
      shells from the great guns miles away. So the order to evacuate was given
      by the authorities.
    </p>
    <p>
      "At one o'clock the following morning the smouldering fire in the
      Cathedral was fanned by a high wind which sprang up, and soon enveloped
      the whole interior; the two great organs, the large pulpit, and the
      Bishop's stalls were entirely consumed. The fire in the Cathedral burned
      two whole days, watched by a mourning throng of the townspeople, who thus
      braved death by the falling bombs. All was consumed but the great door on
      the rue des Charriottes, which did not fall until the week following. On
      the twelfth day, at five in the morning, the fire demolished the
      Bishopric, and the Chapel of the great Seminary. Nothing is now left but a
      heap of smoking cinders and ashes, from which some charred beams protrude.

      "Happily, the 'Descent from the Cross' by Rubens, which decorated the
      Cathedral was removed from its place some hours before the fire, when the
      first of the great shells fell upon the town, and secreted by the priests.
      Also two 'triptychs' by Jean Bellegambe were saved by M. Levoy, who buried
      them in the cellar of the Chateau of the Counte de Hauteclocque. Curiously
      enough, some little time after they were thus secreted, a shell penetrated
      this cellar, but it is said that the damage to the pictures is small and
      may easily be repaired.

    <p>
      "The Abbe Miseron, Vicar of the Cathedral, himself, at the peril of his
      life saved some of the most precious objects in the Treasury. He says
      (happily) that the great tombs of the Bishops, though buried beneath the
      ashes of the Cathedral, have suffered small damage.

      "Of the four colossal statues of the Evangelists, not a trace remains;
      they are entirely pulverized by the great shells exploding before them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of the Library, too, not a trace remains! Some of the archives have, I
      hear, been saved, together with a number of paintings, and M. Dalimeir,
      under secretary of Beaux Arts has decided to send them to Paris. All the
      rest has vanished. A fragment of the plan in relief of the old town of
      Arras, formerly in the Invalides was saved, but nothing remains of the
      Roman antiquities which were discovered in the caves beneath the town, nor
      of the old tapestries, nor the faience, nor of the objects which filled
      the galleries of Natural History in the museum.&mdash;All is gone!

      "In eleven months since the bombardment began, one hundred and
      seventy-five of our citizens have been killed in the streets and in their
      houses, and the number of wounded is more than double that number. After
      the demolition of our charming home, we found shelter for three nights in
      the cellar of a kind neighbor, but on the fifth of July, in the early
      morning, we had to take in our turn 'le chemin d' 'Exil.' For nine months
      now we have had to retreat from place to place, each filled with possible
      dangers, and certain discomfort, but with hearts filled too with profound
      emotion, and the hope that we may soon return to our beloved town and to
      our charming old home, our house so beloved&mdash;so peaceful once in
      those happy days, when the pigeons cooed on the eaves in the warm
      sunlight, the swallows darting to their nests on the chimney&mdash;all the

      LILLE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>UR fruitless
      search in Arras for some examples of the ancient tapestries somewhat
      dampened the ardor of our tour at the very beginning. But in the train on
      our way to Lille we Had a charming view of suburban Arras lying basking in
      the sun, all girt by its verdant belt of dense dark green trees. From the
      window of the railway carriage we saw the horizon expand, and hill after
      hill unroll, covered with waving corn, and realized that France s great
      northern granary lay spread before our eyes, the fields like cabochon
      emeralds set royally in virgin gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      Approaching Lille one got the impression of a region in which the
      commonweal formed the keynote, so to speak, and after the beauties
      surrounding quaint Arras, it seemed somewhat sordid. The embossed fair
      green hills were replaced by level plains; the smiling cornfields vanished
      before barren brown moors. The wealth of the earth here lay far below the
      plains, and man was busied in bringing it to the surface. Ceres gave way
      to Vulcan: Prosperous picturesque farmsteads were displaced by high black
      and ugly furnaces from which tremendous volumes of pitch black smoke
      issued the live-long day, and maybe the night as well. The stacks of grimy
      chimneys were seemingly as high as the spires of churches, and ashes and
      dust covered all. Lille is in the coal region. Somehow as we approached it
      we thought of our own Pittsburgh. The latter is no whit dirtier, but it is
      not so picturesque as was Lille. Roubaix, on the horizon, is even dirtier,
      so a traveling companion informed us, and gave us other information which
      kept us away from that Flemish town. Lille was said to be the
      administrative factor of northern France, in point of industry. The town
      had upwards of one hundred and thirty thousand inhabitants, among whom
      there were some possessed of great fortunes. These built for themselves
      houses of magnificent proportions on both sides of boulevards leading
      nowhere. In this region we found a café restaurant of princely aspect "as
      good as any in Paris," the townspeople proudly said, with a huge mansard
      roof, and a tower which did not fit it. On the river bank, lined with
      barges, were two fine promenades, brand new, and at the end of one was an
      artificial waterfall with plenty of water falling over artificial rocks in
      doubtful taste, of which the Lilleois were so pathetically proud that we
      could only smilingly agree to their extravagant joy in it as a work of
      art. Here we found American made tram cars running through the rather
      commonplace streets, which however were teeming with life and "business."
      In response to a question, a "cabby" urged as the greatest attraction a
      ride out to the hydraulic works situated on a plain, where a great engine
      pumped drinking water from a deep well inclosed in brick work. The whole
      atmosphere of the place was like unto that of one of our own Yankee towns.
      But there were, of course, some notable and picturesque buildings in
      Lille. There was the Exchange, the chief architectural ornament of the
      city, and really it was impossible to see it without pausing in admiration
      of its characteristics. Occupying, as it did, the great Market Place, I
      know of no other building like it save perhaps the Exchange in Antwerp,
      that lovely semi-Moorish hall with its shield-emblazoned frieze, and its
      lofty glass ceiling. This one at Lille was, of course, smaller, but it had
      the great advantage of being free from encroaching buildings, and standing
      quite alone, being visible from all four sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, too, it was a genuine example of its order of architecture, a
      beautifully preserved specimen of the ancient Spanish style, with an added
      touch here and there of Italian Renaissance which blended charmingly. The
      walls were of Flemish red brick, while the Atrium, open to the sky, and
      serving as an inner court, was pure Italian. Here was a fine bronze statue
      of Napoléon I, all clad in imperial robes, about which the busy, bustling
      merchants of Lille transacted some of their business in the afternoons. In
      the mornings we found most delightful solitude here in this court, which
      then by contrast seemed liker unto the cloisters of some abbey than the
      busy commercial center it was later in the day. Emblazoned here upon
      marble slabs one could read of the records of famous citizens of the town
      whose deeds were esteemed as precious and noteworthy. It is said that it
      was at either Lille or Tournai that Napoleon found the golden bees which
      he adopted for the Imperial insignia, these being taken from the tomb of a
      Frankish king.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were further reminded of the Palais Royal in Paris, in the small shops,
      most brilliantly lighted at night, which formed the outer ring of the
      building. Here were displayed <i>bijoux-or-et-argent</i>, and also more or
      less exquisitely made robes for Madame de Lille.
    </p>
    <p>
      The upper part of the building, which was two-storied, had dormer windows,
      and a quadrant of beautifully designed and executed interlaced stonework
      with a profusion of caryatides, pilasters, and bands of carved stone fruit
      and garlands of flowers, all of the greatest richness, within an
      astonishingly small space. Nowhere could we find the name of the
      architect, but it is said that the foundation was laid in 1652 by the
      Spanish. Workmen were busy cleaning a small turret of most graceful design
      which rose from above the walls of this quaint old Hispano-Flemish
      monument, and I noted the care with which the work was being done, a
      pleasing testimonial to the love of the people of Lille for their ancient
      work of art.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Rihour Palace was far greater in size than the Exchange, but it did
      not match it in importance. The greater part of it was modern, for it was
      almost destroyed in the eighteenth century. Used as a town hall in the
      time of Louis Philippe, it became a sort of academy of art, wherein was
      displayed, and very well, too, a princely collection of paintings of
      Flemish and Dutch schools, and also the great collection of drawings known
      as the "Wicar Legacy," representing the Italian school, and containing a
      piece of sculpture of which all the museums of Europe envied that of
      Lille.
    </p>
    <p>
      This in the catalogue was described as, "A waxen head of Raphael's time,
      titled thus by the hand of Wicar himself when in 1834 he drew up in Rome
      the inventory of the old Italian art collection." * Huet regards this as a
      marvel that one should not miss seeing. He says, "In truth, one fancies
      himself to be looking at the transparent, softly tinted face of one of
      Raphael's Madonnas. Innocence and gentleness dispute each other the palm
      in the expression of the features, they have settled on the pure brow,
      they play tranquilly and somewhat sadly around the mouth, they are crowned
      by the plaits of the fair tresses." We admired the head and treasured
      Wicar's description of it.

      Enumeration of the treasures contained in the Palais des Beaux Arts would
      take a volume in itself. Suffice it to say here that the collection
      contained in this edifice was among the most important in all France.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rumors have appeared in print during the last two years, that this whole
      collection has been carefully packed and sent to Berlin. At this date of
      writing (May, 1917) Lille has not yet been evacuated by the Germans, and
      we are told that none of the buildings has been destroyed save some
      unimportant ones near the railway station. Just what will be the fate of
      the town may be conjectured when one reflects upon what happened to Noyon,
      to Rheims, to Soissons, and to St. Quentin, when the invaders were no
      longer able to hold them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us pray that the Musée Wicar may be spared, by some happy chance.
      Wicar was an artist who died in 1834, who made a great deal of money by
      his work, and whose real hobby was the collection of the drawings by great
      masters, including nearly two hundred and fifty drawings by Michelangelo,
      sixty-eight by Raphael, and a large number by Francia, Titian and others,
      besides endless examples of the Renaissance.

      Wandering about in Lille one came upon some handsome buildings behind the
      Hôtel de Ville in the Rue du Palais, which proved to be those of the
      Military Hospital, formerly a Jewish college. Here was an ancient chapel
      of the seventeenth century, containing a remarkable altar, and some huge
      dark paintings which may have been good, but the light was so dim, and
      they were hung so high that it was impossible to examine them. Continuing
      the wandering one reached the fine old town gate, the ancient Porte de la
      Barre, in a good state of preservation. There were a number of these
      gates. The old Porte de Paris was part of the fortifications, and built in
      the form of a sort of triumphal arch to the honor of Louis XVI. Some
      quaint streets as yet untouched by the march of commercialism, led from
      here into busy thoroughfares teeming with life and activity. One, running
      eastwards from the Porte de Paris, passed between a square and the old
      Hôtel du Génie, and this led one to the Gothic church of St. Sauveur,
      noteworthy for its double aisles, and most elaborate white marble high
      altar, carved in the Gothic style and with a bewildering detail and
      accompaniment of statues and alto-reliefs. There was also the great church
      of St. Maurice in the Flamboyant style, with a most notable west portal,
      most carefully restored in very good taste. An open-work spire of stone
      rose above it, all of admirable character. The interior proved to be
      distinguished by the width of the nave and the double aisles all of the
      same height, and by the richness of the effect lent by the remarkable
      lightness of the columns.
    </p>
    <p>
      The handsomest streets of the old town were the Rue Esquermoise and the
      Rue Royale. Near the entrance to the latter was the ancient church of St.
      Catherine, founded in the twelfth century, and rebuilt in its present
      style in the sixteenth, and restored again in the eighteenth century. Here
      above the altar was a fine "Martyrdom of St. Catherine," by Rubens.
    </p>
    <p>
      In common with the other Flemish cities of Douai, Cambrai, and
      Valenciennes, Lille suffered regularly from sieges and sackings, invasions
      and conquests from its very beginnings. "In June, 1297, Philip the
      Handsome, in person, laid siege to Lille, and on the 13th of August,
      Robert, Count of Artois, at the head of the French chivalry, gained at
      Furnes, over the Flemish army a victory which decided the campaign. Lille
      capitulated."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The English reinforcements arrived too late and served no other purpose
      but that of inducing Philip to grant the Flemings a truce for two years. A
      fruitless attempt was made with the help of Pope Boniface VIII, to change
      the truce into a lasting peace. The very day on which it expired, Charles,
      Count of Valois, and brother of Philip the Handsome, entered Flanders with
      a powerful army, surprised Douai,... gave a reception to its magistrates
      who came and offered him the keys. 'The burghers of the towns of
      Flanders,' says a chronicler of the age, 'were all bribed by gifts or
      promises from the King of France, who would never have dared to invade
      their frontier had they been faithful to their Count.' The Flemish
      communes desired the peace necessary for the prosperity of their commerce;
      but patriotic anxieties wrested with material interests....
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the spring of 1304 the cry of war resounded everywhere. Philip had
      laid an import extraordinary upon all real property in his kingdom;
      regulars and reserves had been summoned to Arras to attack the Flemings by
      land and sea. He had taken into his pay a Genoese fleet commanded by
      Regnier de Grimaldi, a celebrated Italian admiral; and it arrived in the
      North Sea, blockaded Zierickzee, a maritime town of Zealand.... The
      Flemish fleet was beaten. A great battle took place on the 17th of August
      between the two great land armies at Mons-en-Puelle, or Mont-en-Pévèle,
      according to the true local spelling, near Lille. The action was for some
      time indecisive, and even after it was over both sides hesitated about
      claiming a victory; but when the Flemings saw their camp swept off and
      rifled, and when they no longer found in it 'their fine stuffs of Bruges
      and Ypres, their wines of Rochelle, their beers of Cambrai, and their
      cheeses of Bethune,' they declared that they would return to their
      hearths; and their leaders, unable to restrain them, were obliged to shut
      themselves up in Lille, whither Philip, who had himself retired to Arras,
      came to besiege them. When the first days of downheartedness were over,
      and the danger which threatened Lille, and the remains of the Flemish army
      became evident, all Flanders rushed to arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The labors of the workshop and the field were everywhere suspended; the
      women kept guard in the towns; you might traverse the country without
      meeting a single man, for they were all in the camp at Courtrai, to the
      number of twelve hundred thousand (!) according to popular exaggeration,
      swearing to one another that they would rather die fighting than live in
      slavery. Philip was astounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I thought the Flemings were destroyed,' said he, 'but they seem to rain
      from heaven.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "The burghers of Bruges had made themselves a new seal whereon the old
      symbol of the bridge of their city on the river Reye was replaced by the
      Lion of Flanders, wearing the crown and armed with the cross, with this
      inscription: 'The Lion hath roared and burst his fetters' (Rugiit leo,
      Vincula fregit).
    </p>
    <p>
      "During ten years, from 1305 to 1314, there was between France and
      Flanders a continual alternation of reciprocal concessions and
      retractions, of treaties concluded and of renewed insurrections without
      decisive and ascertained results. It was neither peace nor war; and after
      the death of Philip the Handsome, his successors were destined for a long
      time to come to find again and again amongst the Flemish communes deadly
      enmities and grievous perils." *

      What wonder then that Lille retains so few remarkable public monuments.
      Perhaps of all the Flemish towns she suffered most from pillage and fire.
      Farther on in the Rue Royale, beyond the statue of General Négrier, was
      the eighteenth century church of St. André, once belonging to the "Carmes
      déchaussés," where there were some good paintings by a native artist,
      Arnould de Vuez, who enjoyed considerable celebrity. Following the
      attractive quays along the river front, which was teeming with life and
      movement, one reached the small square of St. Martin, where was the church
      of "Notre Dame de la Trielle," which is said to have occupied the site of
      the ancient moated Chateau du Buc, which formed the origin of the city of
      Lille, and which the Flemish to this day call Ryssel. A fortress of the
      first class, Lille's citadel is said to have been Vauban's masterpiece,
      and perhaps this is one of the reasons why the invaders of 1914 surrounded
      it with the network of concrete trenches and galleries which formed the
      angle of the famous Hinden-burg line after the disastrous retreat from
      Arras in April, 1917. So far Lille has not suffered very much from the
      bombardment of this present year, but it is safe to say now that the
      invader will not spare it in retreat.

      AMIENS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HERE was no better
      way of realizing the great bulk and height of the Cathedral than by
      proceeding to the banks of the river Somme northward, and from this point
      appraising its architectural wonder rising above the large and small old
      gray houses, tier above tier, misted in the soft clouds of gray smoke from
      their myriad chimneys, capped with red dots of chimney pots, "a giant in
      repose."
    </p>
    <p>
      In approaching Amiens the traveler was offered no "coup d'oeil" like that
      of other cathedral towns; here "this largest church in the world except
      St. Peter's, at Rome," was hidden from view as one entered the town, and
      followed the Rue des Trois Cailloux, along what was formerly the
      boundaries of the ancient walls. It was difficult to obtain a good view of
      the façade, that of the west point was seen from a parvis, which qualified
      the difference in level between the east and west ends, and here was the
      central porch which took its name, "Porche de le Beau Dieu d'Amiens," from
      the figure of the Savior on its central pillar, and of which Ruskin wrote,
      "at the time of its erection, it was beyond all that had then been reached
      of sculptured tenderness."
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not known at this time of writing (May, 1917) whether Amiens has
      suffered greatly at the hands of the Germans. Perhaps without its
      destruction there have been sufficient crimes committed against the church
      in the name of military necessity, and it thus has been spared.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some reason or other Ruskin was not overenthusiastic over Amiens. He
      described the beautiful "flèche," which rose so gracefully from the great
      bulk against the sky, as "merely the caprice of a village carpenter," and
      he further declared that the Cathedral of Amiens is "in dignity inferior
      to Chartres, in sublimity to Beauvais, in decorative splendor to Rheims,
      and in loveliness of figure sculpture to Bourges." On the other hand, the
      great Viollet-le-Duc called it the "Parthenon of Gothic Architecture."
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the two authorities, one may safely pin one's faith to the opinion of
      the eminent Frenchman, who spent his life in restoring great works rather
      than in abusing them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whewell says: "The mind is filled and elevated by the enormous height of
      the building (140 feet), its lofty and many colored clerestory, its grand
      proportions, its noble simplicity. The proportion of height to breadth is
      almost double that to which we are accustomed in English cathedrals; the
      lofty solid piers, which bear up this height, are far more massive in
      their plan than the light and graceful clusters of our English churches,
      each of them being a cylinder with four engaged columns. The polygonal E
      apse is a feature which we seldom see, and nowhere so exhibited, and on
      such a scale; and the peculiar French arrangement which puts the walls at
      the outside edge of the buttresses, and thus forms interior chapels all
      around, in addition to the aisles, gives a vast multiplicity of
      perspective below, which fills out the idea produced by the gigantic
      height of the center. Such terms will not be extravagant when it is
      recollected that the roof is half as high again as Westminster Abbey."
      Indeed this great height is only surpassed by that of one cathedral in all
      of France&mdash;Beauvais.
    </p>
    <p>
      The vast arches here rose to nearly half the height of the structure, and
      then above these the architect placed a lovely band or frieze of carved
      foliage; then the triforium, and above this the glorious windows,
      separated from each other only by tall slender pillars springing
      gracefully from heavier ones. Nearly all the original painted glass was
      destroyed in the thirteenth century, but that which replaced it was of a
      certainty entirely satisfying.
    </p>
    <p>
      Between two immense pillars at the entrance to the nave were the heavily
      ornamented gilded brass tombs of the Bishops who founded the Cathedral.
      That on the left was Geoffroi d'Eu, who died in 1236, and on the right was
      that of Evrard de Fouilloy, who died in 1223. Each shows a recumbent
      figure in full robes inclosed in Gothic canopies with pointed arches, and
      sustained by lions. The great organ loft was beneath the magnificent "rose
      de mer" window which was filled with the arms of the house of Firmin de
      Coquerel. In the choir were one hundred and ten carved stalls, said to
      have been designed and made by local artists of Amiens, and these alone
      would have made any cathedral noteworthy. According to that eminent
      authority, Mr. Francis Bond, the height of the nave and the aisles is
      three times their span, and this feature gave the effect for which the
      architect worked, that is, a splendid blaze of luminosity shining down
      into gloomy and most mysterious shadow. This blaze of light and color came
      not only from the clerestory, but also from the triforium, in which the
      superb blue glass shone with celestial splendor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The meaning of the word "triforium" is perhaps somewhat obscure to all
      save architects. Herbert Marshall * defines the word as "Applied to the
      ambulatory or passage, screened by an arcade, which runs between the pier
      arches and clerestory windows and is considered to refer to the three
      openings, or spaces, 'trinae fores,' into which the arcading was sometimes
      divided. It probably has nothing to do with openings in multiples of
      three, nor with a Latinised form of 'thoroughfare' as suggested by
      Parker's Glossary, although the main idea is a passage running round the
      inside of a church, either as at Westminster, in the form of an ambulatory
      chamber, or of a gallery pierced through the main walls, from whence the
      structure may be inspected without the trouble of using ladders. M. Enlart
      in his 'Manuel d'Archéologie Française' derives the word from a French
      adjective, 'trifore,' or 'trifoire,' through the Latin 'transforatus,' a
      passage pierced through the thickness of the wall; and this idea of a
      passageway is certainly suggested by an old writer, Gervase, who, in his
      description of the new cathedral of Canterbury, rebuilt after the fire,
      alludes to the increased number of passages round the church under the
      word 'triforia.' 'Ibi triforium unum, hie duo in Choro, et in alâ
      ecclesiae tercium.'"

      Ruskin wrote in his diary under date of May 11th, 1857: "I had a happy
      walk here (Amiens) this afternoon, down among the branching currents of
      the Somme: it divides into five or six, shallow, green and not
      over-wholesome; some quite narrow and foul, running beneath clusters of
      fearful houses, reeling masses of rotten timber; and a few mere stumps of
      pollard willow sticking out of the banks of soft mud, only retained in
      shape of bank by being shored up with timbers; and boats like paper boats,
      nearly as thin at least, for costermongers to paddle about in among the
      weeds, the water soaking through the lath bottoms, and floating the dead
      leaves from the vegetable baskets with which they were loaded. Miserable
      little back yards, opening to the water, with steep stone steps down to
      it, and little platforms for the ducks; and separate duck staircases,
      composed of a sloping board with cross bits of wood leading to the ducks'
      doors; and sometimes a flower pot or two on them, or even a flower&mdash;one
      group of wall flowers and geraniums curiously vivid, being seen against
      the darkness of a dyer's backyard, who had been dyeing black, and all was
      black in his yard but the flowers, and they fiery and pure; the water by
      no means so, but still working its way steadily over the weeds, until it
      narrowed into a current strong enough to turn two or three 'wind mills,'
      (!) one working against the side of an old Flamboyant Gothic church, whose
      richly traceried buttresses sloped down into the filthy stream; all
      exquisitely picturesque, and no less miserable. (! ) We delight in seeing
      the figures in these boats, pushing them about the bits of blue water, in
      Prout's drawings; but as I looked to-day at the unhealthy face and
      melancholy mien of the man in the boat pushing his load of peat along the
      ditch, and of the people, men as well as women, who sat spinning gloomily
      at cottage doors, I could not help feeling how many persons must pay for
      my picturesque subject and happy walk."
    </p>
    <p>
      The reader will probably exclaim: "Well, if this is Ruskin's idea of a
      'happy walk,' what then would be his description of a gloomy one?"
    </p>
    <p>
      We did not find the view of the town so squalid as this. Rising against
      the golden glow of the evening sky, the great bulk of the Cathedral massed
      itself in purple mist, its slender needle-like center tower and spire
      piercing the sky. Below lay the dull reds and slaty grays of the houses,
      concealed here and there by the massive foliage of the trees that lined
      the river bank. Barges of picturesque shape were tied up to the banks here
      and there, with lines of pink, white and blue freshly washed clothes
      strung along the decks, where children played, and there were brightly
      painted cabin deck houses, all white and green, from the chimney pipes of
      which ascended long pale lines of smoke from the galley stoves, showing
      that the evening meal was being cooked. On the decks of these barges
      nervous shaggy dogs ran up and down barking furiously at one thing or
      another; over all seemed to rest the air of well being and sweet content.
      If there were stagnant pools of filthy water, as Ruskin claimed, we saw
      them not, nor did the peasants seem unhealthy or miserable to our eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amiens was delightful to look upon, and we drove back to the hotel quite
      satisfied with our first view of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Day by day afterwards we haunted the great Cathedral, studying it from
      every viewpoint. Again and again we returned to the choir to gloat over
      the one hundred and ten magnificent stalls, carved as fluently as if
      modeled in clay, the forms so flowing and graceful as to suggest living
      branches, pinnacle crowning pinnacle, and detail of grace of design so
      exquisite as to be almost painful to follow&mdash;"Imperishable, fuller of
      leafage than any forest, and fuller of story than any book." (Ruskin.) The
      outside wall of the choir was quite concealed by the most richly
      Flamboyant Gothic archwork. In these arches were quantities of figures of
      saints, all emblazoned with gold and crimson and blue. These groups have
      been described by Lubke so well that I can do no better than quote him:
      "St. John is shown when he sees Christ and points him out to the
      multitude; then St. John preaching in the wilderness, and the Baptism of
      Christ, which is arranged with peculiar beauty and simplicity; lastly St.
      John as a preacher of repentance when the listening multitude is depicted
      with life. Then there are four scenes: the Apprehension of St. John; the
      Banquet, at which Herodias asks for the head of the Preacher of Repentance&mdash;a
      scene executed with genre-like style, the figures appearing in the costume
      of the period; the 'Beheading of St. John'; and, lastly, another banquet
      scene, in which the severed head appears on the table, and Herodias puts
      out the eyes, at which her daughter sinks in a swoon, and is caught up by
      a young man, while a page in horror runs away with the dish. Below these
      larger representations, in the one case in ten, in the other in five
      medallions, scenes from the youth of St. John are depicted. The relief is
      more shallow, and with simple arrangement is very attractive in
      expression."
    </p>
    <p>
      The great blazing rose windows of the transept were named "Fire" and
      "Water," but which was which we never quite discovered, because of a
      difference of opinion held by those whom we questioned, but this did not
      in the least affect our opinion of their great artistic value, or
      interfere with our admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the south transept we readily found the gravestone in memory of the
      Spanish Captain Hernando Tiello, who captured Amiens in 1597, and just
      opposite, the great stone sarcophagus of the Canon Claude Pierre, who must
      have been a canon of great importance, to have been so favored and placed.
      In the Chapel of Notre Dame de Puy were a great number of marble tablets
      emblazoned with the names of the Fraternity of Puy, and bore reliefs in
      marble, showing scenes in the life of the Virgin Mary. Here there was much
      intricate Flamboyant tracery framing some scenes in the life of St. James
      the Great, of the sixteenth century style, presented by Canon Guillaume
      Aucouteaux.
    </p>
    <p>
      The north transept contained the fine monument of the Canon Jehan Wyts,
      who died in 1523. This showed the temple at Jerusalem, in four scenes
      depicting the "Sanctum," the "Atrium," the "Tabernaculum," and
      "Sanctum-Sanctorum." In this transept was buried the remains of the comic
      poet "Gresset," who flourished in the eighteenth century, and a great
      shrine for the head of John the Baptist, said to be incased here, and to
      have been brought from the Holy Land and presented with imposing
      ceremonies, by the Crusader Wallon de Sarton, who was likewise Canon of
      Picquigny. Singularly enough there were several other heads incased in
      magnificent jeweled reliquaries which were to be seen in other churches,
      notably in the south of France, and in Genoa, each one claiming, with much
      documentary proof, to be the sole and only authentic head of the Great
      Preacher of Repentance.
    </p>
    <p>
      In one of the chapels in the left aisle of the nave, that of St. Saulve,
      was a remarkable crucifix, which enjoyed great repute, for it was gravely
      alleged to have bowed its head upon the occasion of the installment of the
      sacred relics of St. Honoré.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inside the great open porches the whole space was filled with the most
      delicate fourteenth century lacework in stone. The principal one showed on
      its frontal a statue of St. Michael conquering the dragon. The fine
      ironwork of the doors was made in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries
      by natives of Amiens, whose names are forgotten. Walter Pater
      ("Miscellaneous Studies") says: "The builders of the church seem to have
      projected no very noticeable towers; though it is conventional to regret
      their absence, especially with visitors from England, where indeed
      cathedral and other towers are apt to be good and really make their
      mark.... The great western towers are lost in the west front, the
      grandest, perhaps the earliest, of its species&mdash;three profound
      sculptured portals; a double gallery above, the upper gallery carrying
      colossal images of twenty-two kings of the house of Judah, ancestors of
      our Lady; then the great rose; above it the Singers' Gallery, half marking
      the gable of the nave, and uniting at their topmost stories the twin, but
      not exactly equal or similar towers, oddly oblong in plan as if meant to
      carry pyramids or spires. In most cases these early Pointed churches are
      entangled, here and there, by the construction of the old round-arched
      style, the heavy Norman or other, Romanesque chapel or aisle, side by
      side, though in strange contrast, with the soaring new Gothic nave or
      transept. But of the older manner of the round arch, the 'plein-cintre,'
      Amiens has nowhere, or almost nowhere, a trace. The Pointed style, fully
      pronounced, but in all the purity of its first period, found here its
      completest expression."
    </p>
    <p>
      Amiens, the ancient capital of Picardy, was one of the greatest of the
      manufacturing towns of France. There were many large factories engaged in
      the production of cashmere, velvet, linen, and woolens, and in the early
      morning, and again at night, thousands of the employees filled the streets
      of the town on their way to and from work. It was called by the Ambiani,
      before it was captured by Cæsar, Samarobriva, and was their chief town.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christianity was introduced by St. Firmin in the year 301, which perhaps
      is as far back as any one cares to go in the matter. And history farther
      cautions the reader not to confound this St. Firmin with that other St.
      Firmin, who was only a "Confessor" or something of the sort.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Normans seem to have had a strong desire to put an end to the town,
      for they regularly pillaged and burned it. The place was ceded to the Duke
      of Burgundy in 1435, but was recovered in 1463 by Louis XI. The Spaniards
      conquered it in 1597, but Henry IV retook it from them. The Peace of
      Amiens between France, Great Britain, Spain and Holland was signed here in
      1802.
    </p>
    <p>
      The battle of Amiens, in the Franco-Prussian War, resulted in the entry of
      the Germans in November, 1870. Its present fate is problematical, but it
      would seem, in view of the retirement of the invader northward of Arras
      and Lens, that the great and noble monuments of the ancient town are now
      safe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Heinrich Heine long ago wrote the following prophetic words: "Christianity&mdash;and
      this is its highest merit&mdash;has in some degree softened, but it could
      not destroy, the brutal German joy of battle. When once the taming
      talisman, the Cross, breaks in two, the savagery of the old fighters, the
      senseless Berserker fury, of which the Northern poets sing and say so
      much, will gush up anew. That talisman is decayed, and the day will come
      when it will piteously collapse. Then the old stone gods will rise from
      the silent ruins, and rub the dust of a thousand years from their eyes.
      Thor, with his giant's hammer, will at last spring up, and shatter to bits
      the Gothic Cathedrals."

      PÉRONNE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE delightful
      banks of the river Somme are imprinted on one's memory among those "sweet
      places" where it would seem as though man could not but choose to be
      happy, so liberally had nature decked them with her gifts. Yet all of this
      region formerly known as Flanders, has from time immemorial been war's
      favorite playground, "the Cockpit of Europe."
    </p>
    <p>
      Even in the intervals of wars, strife equally bitter, if less bloody, has
      raged here,&mdash;the struggle of industry against adequate reward. One
      could never forget the sight of women laboring early and late in the
      fields, or harnessed together at the end of long tow lines, painfully
      dragging barges against the current of the river, or in the factory yards,
      trampling with bare feet a mixture of coal dust and clay which, molded
      into briquettes, was used as fuel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strangely enough, these women and girls, some of them of tender age,
      seemed happy and content with their work. The sound of their singing as
      they labored could be heard for a long distance. As the barges passed on
      the river bank, with these women bending forward, straining at the yoked
      ends of the tow rope, moving slowly step by step, we noted that not seldom
      they were quite handsome of face, and of good figure. Invariably they
      saluted us good humoredly with smiles, but when I removed my hat in
      response, I could see that this courtesy struck them as unusual, and did
      not leave the impression I desired. Thereafter I modified the salutation.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the inn in Péronne a young "commis-voyageur" with whom I made
      conversation, and related this incident, told me that I had better beware
      of offering such civilities in future, since these Amazons had been known
      to seize strangers for fancied offenses, and after giving them rough
      treatment, cast them into the river. He called upon the proprietor of the
      inn to substantiate his warning, and the latter satisfied me as to its
      truth, giving details which need not be set down here, and which quite
      decided the matter.
    </p>

      Péronne as an historic and notable town was second to none in all Picardy.
      Here the early kings had a great palace given to them by Clovis II.

      Erchinold, the Mayor, erected a monastery near by for Scotch monks,
      presided over by St. Fursy. Not a trace of this now remains. It is said to
      have contained the tomb of Charles the Simple, who died of famine at the
      hands of Hubert in a dungeon. When Philip d'Alsace, Count of Vermandois,
      was killed in the Crusades (1199) the towns of Péronne and St. Quentin
      were united to the crown of France, and so remained. Charles V, in 1536
      unsuccessfully besieged Péronne, and during this siege a young woman named
      Marie Fourré performed prodigious deeds of heroism which history records.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great Ligue of 1577 was proclaimed here, following its announcement at
      Paris. Until the Duke of Wellington captured it on his way to Paris' after
      the battle of Waterloo, Péronne-la-Pucelle had never been taken by an
      enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Franco-Prussian War, 1870-71, Péronne was sacked and burned after a
      most memorable siege, in which many of the remarkable old buildings were
      destroyed, but in 1910 the town, when I last saw it, was one of the
      quaintest in all Picardy. There was a remarkable old church here, that of
      St. Jean, which dated from the sixteenth century, which had a portal of
      three Gothic arches and arcades surmounted by a great flamboyant
      rose-window, the glass of which, though modern, was of fine quality and
      workmanship. It had a tower flanked by a "tourelle" of beautiful
      proportions, and in the interior the vaulting, pulpit, and the stained
      glass windows were pronounced by experts to be well-nigh faultless.
    </p>
    <p>
      This church, and the most singular and picturesque Hôtel de Ville
      (sixteenth century), a sketch of which I made in 1910, the invaders took
      great pains entirely to destroy in April, 1917, when they made their
      celebrated "victorious retreat." The latest accounts say that not a trace
      of these two remarkable monuments now exists, that for a week or more
      before the retreat, the German engineers used tons of explosives to
      destroy them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gray old square before the Hôtel de Ville is now a yawning pit,
      bordered by shapeless piles of stone and ashes.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this time we know not what other mischief the invader has committed in
      this neighborhood. There are endless opportunities for destruction and
      pillage, and we may be fully prepared for irreparable damage and losses in
      all of this region before the Iconoclasts are driven back to their last
      line of defenses.
    </p>
    <p>
      All of Champagne, of Picardy,&mdash;all of Flanders were filled with
      exquisite villages, towns, and cities, each of which was unique in works
      of art and antiquity. These have shriveled like a garden of flowers before
      a heavy frost. This great catastrophe has so stunned humanity, that we are
      only beginning to realize what it means.
    </p>
    <p>
      The invader says contemptuously that no cathedral is worth the life of one
      German soldier. So Rheims has been destroyed; so St. Peter's of Louvain;
      so&mdash;but why enumerate here?&mdash;The list is recorded in letters of
      fire.

      CAMBRAI, and the SMALL TOWNS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE "Cameracum" of
      ancient days of Roman occupation, holding this name up to the twelfth
      century, Cambrai, at the outbreak of the war in 1914, was entirely
      satisfying to the seeker of the charms of picturesqueness, as well as the
      historian. After what is known as the period of the Antonine Itinerary, it
      became the capital of a petty episcopal arrondisement, under the
      protection of the Dukes of Burgundy who, unable to hold it, gave it over
      "for privileges" to the German emperors, who thereafter retained it under
      the title of "Châtelains," as it was a fortified stronghold.
    </p>
    <p>
      Situated on a hillside on the right bank of the river Scheldt, it was a
      busy and prosperous commercial town, with a semi-Flemish population of
      about twenty-five thousand. Its history in thumbnail form is as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1508 the Emperor Maximilian, Pope Julius II, Ferdinand of Aragon, and
      Louis XII of France formed here the celebrated League of Cambrai, which
      was directed against Venice. In 1529 the so-called Paix de Dames was
      signed by Louise of Savoy and Margaret of Austria, who negotiated its
      provisions in the castle on the hill, for Francis I and Charles V.
      However, by the treaty of Nimwegen, Louis XV recovered it, and it was thus
      held by France until captured by the Duke of Wellington in 1815.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many celebrated men were born at Cambrai, or became identified with the
      town, such as the chronicler, Enguer-rand de Monstrelet, who died in 1453.
      The great Fénelon was Archbishop of Cambrai, as was also Cardinal Dubois,
      who served as minister for Louis XV, and then follows an array of names
      that lent glory to the annals of Flanders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps few know that the town gave name to that fine linen which was
      produced here in the fifteenth century, the invention of a native named
      Baptiste. The English named the cloth "Cambric," but to the Flemish and
      French it was known, and is still for that matter, as "Ba'tiste" after the
      inventor. At the outbreak of the war this linen cloth was the chief
      product of the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      Entrance to the town was through the gate called "Porte Robert," near
      which was the citadel. There was a large and impressive square called the
      "Esplanade," where statues had been raised to "Batiste" and the historian
      "Enguerrand de Monstrelet." Then followed the "Place aux Bois," lined with
      handsome trees, and large "Place d'Arms," on which was the "Hôtel de
      Ville," which, while of comparatively modern construction and rebuilt in
      the last century, was sufficiently interesting even to a student of
      ancient Flemish architecture. Its most elaborate façade was sculptured by
      one Hiolle of Valenciennes. The tower bore two gigantic statues, much
      venerated by the townspeople, named respectively "Martin" and "Martine,"
      but curiously enough there was a wide difference of opinion as to which
      was which, some saying that the left hand giant was Martin, and others
      protesting the contrary. The figures dated from the time of Charles V, and
      were presented by him to the town in 1510.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the square at the opening of the Rue St. Martin was a fine Gothic
      belfry dated 1447, and attached to the church of that name. This contained
      a notable chime of bells, a carillon, the work of the Hemonys. * In the
      Rue de Noyon was the Cathedral of "Notre Dame," part of which had been
      rebuilt since a fire which consumed it about sixty years ago. The interior
      contained notably the fine marble and bronze monument of Fénelon, and a
      statue to this celebrity, the work of David d'Angers, all worth a
      considerable journey to see. The body of the church was of the eighteenth
      century and while of purity in detail, offered no very striking features.
      There were eight very large mural paintings "en grisaille" after the works
      of Rubens, by Geeraerts, a modern artist of Antwerp, but these, despite
      the obvious merit of the work, seemed somehow out of key with the
      interior.
    </p>

     * See "Vanished Towers and Chimes of Flanders,"
       for chapter on bell founding.

    <p>
      Wandering about, we came upon a small street in which we found a
      remarkable collection of paintings of the Netherlands School owned by a
      private collector, who was pleased to show them, and delighted by our
      enthusiasm over their qualities. This gentleman insisted upon becoming our
      guide about the town, and showed us so many attentions that my Lady Anne
      became bored with him, and this led to our leaving Cambrai before the time
      we had set&mdash;but we left a letter of appreciation and thanks addressed
      to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He it was who brought us to the church of St. Géry in the Place Fénelon,
      on the site of one founded by St. Vaast in 520. This had a remarkable dome
      which was upheld by four very slender columns, of very unusual character,
      and there was also a magnificent renaissance "jube," or altar screen, of
      colored marble, and a transept containing a large painting of the
      "Entombment," attributed to Rubens. The "Episcopal Palace of Fénelon" was
      just across the street, or at least a fragment of the original building,
      with a very richly decorated triple portal in the Renaissance style.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was this palace that Fénelon opened to the fugitives of the battle of
      Malplaquet, who thronged the town of Cambrai for protection and food.
      History states that every corner of the building was filled with the
      hapless people, and their small belongings hastily gathered together in
      the flight. The gardens and courts were crowded with cows, calves, and
      pigs, and the scene is said to have been indescribable. Emanuel de
      Broglie, who wrote the account ("Fénelon a Cambrai," de Broglie), says,
      "Officers to the number of one hundred and fifty, both French and
      prisoners of war, were received by Fénelon at his house, and seated at his
      table at one time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "God will help us," said the Archbishop; "Providence hath infinite
      resources on which I can confidently rely. Only let us give all we have:
      it is my duty and my pleasure."

      Over the side doors were inscriptions on "banderoles"&mdash;"A Clare
      Justitia" on one, and on the other "A gladio pax." The fine "Chateau de
      Selles," on the banks of the Scheldt River, was built in the fifteenth
      century. The beautiful reliefs of its gables, its statues, and the wrought
      iron grills of its balconies were still perfect, and the view from its
      green terrace was most enjoyable.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a curious sort of penthouse shown to us, near a building called
      "Vieux Château" of which pillars with rudely sculptured capitals remained.
      Near this was a well with some ancient rusty ironwork, and a stone which
      our quondam guide said had served in ages long ago as a block in
      executions. Somehow we thought that he lied, and with considerable skill
      withal, but we dismissed him with payment of a franc for his pains. He did
      not go, however, but followed us about at a distance muttering to himself
      and occasionally waving his hands in a most absurd manner, until at length
      we happily lost him.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a curious small building called the Grange aux Dimes, divided
      into two parts, one subterranean, the other on the level of the soil. Two
      staircases, one inside, the other outside, led to a hall on the first
      floor. This was divided by two ranges of pillars, with ornate capitals of
      foliage. The door to the subterranean passage was unfastened and we
      ventured down into the darkness and must for a short distance. I am
      convinced that we might have had some adventures below had we explored the
      tunnel. Near this was "Le Puits," supposed to be the entrance to other
      vast vaults, a subterranean town extending beneath the hill for miles, and
      formerly used for many purposes in the Middle Ages.
    </p>
    <p>
      These vaults were to be found in many of the towns hereabouts, and during
      the occupancy of the country by the Germans since the invasion of 1914,
      the soldiers have used them to store away ammunition and supplies. Over
      these small towns for three years now have raged battles the like of which
      for fierceness and bloody loss the world has never seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The small town of Marcoing, about five miles from Cambrai, had one of
      these wonderful caverns of refuge dating from the Middle Ages, and there
      were others at Villers-Guizlain and at Honnecourt, where there were the
      ruins of a Roman town, and an immense church with a porch of the eleventh
      century. This was said to have been a famous place of pilgrimage in the
      twelfth century. Tradition has it that in that century three brothers of
      the family of Courcy le Marchais were taken prisoners during the crusades.
      In the power of the Sultan they languished, until at length he bethought
      him to send his young daughter to their dungeon, where they lay in chains,
      thinking that she might by the power of her beauty and eloquence bring
      them to the faith of the Mussulmans. But strange to relate, she it was who
      succumbed to the arguments of the three fair-haired brothers, and finally
      promised to become a Christian provided that they show her an image of the
      Holy Virgin of whom they had so eloquently told her. Now the three
      brothers had no image of the Virgin, everything having been taken from
      them when they were cast into the dungeon. But all at once, says the
      Chronicle, the image of the Virgin bathed in golden Celestial light
      appeared miraculously before them in a niche on the wall, so the Sultan's
      daughter, thus convinced, not only set the three fair-haired brothers
      free, but accompanied them, bearing in her bosom the sacred image, which
      henceforth was enshrined here on the altar and venerated.
    </p>
    <p>
      The three brothers then built a church in the twelfth century, on the site
      of which this present one of the fourteenth century was erected. Its
      portal was fifteenth century, and at the cross was a spire with quaintly
      formed pinnacles. Inside, a remarkably rich "jube," or altar screen,
      divided the nave from the choir, almost hiding the sanctuary containing a
      singular coal black doll-like sort of image, and a large collection of
      "Ex-votos," with some other offerings most tawdry in character.
    </p>

      North of Valenciennes and very near the Flemish border was the old town of
      St. Amand-les-Eaux, famous for its mud baths for the cure of rheumatism
      and gout since the time of the Romans. The town was situated at the
      confluence of the rivers Elnon and Scarpe, and is said to have grown up
      around an abbey built by St. Amand in the seventh century. Save for the
      portal and the façade of the church nothing remained of the original
      structure. A tower containing a fine carillon of bells by Flemmish
      founders, perhaps the Van den Gheyns of Malines, is said to have been
      designed by Peter Paul Rubens. From the summit of the tower a wonderful
      view of the surrounding country was had, and for this reason the Germans
      blew it up in April, 1917, before their retreat.

      There was here a quaint Hôtel de Ville in the Flemish-Renaissance style,
      much floriated in parts. Let us hope that this has been spared. The site
      of the ancient abbey had been most charmingly covered with a blooming
      garden of brilliant flowers, and here children and nurses played, while
      "invalides" dozed on the benches in the sunlight. From the baths a very
      wild and beautiful park stretched across the country to the forest of
      Raismes through the forest of St. Amand.

      Epehy is another small town now held by the Germans because of its
      strategical value. It is on the ancient Roman road, or "Chaussée
      Brunehaut," which runs from Arras to Rheims. Under the great church are
      subterranean galleries, which, it is said, stretch for unknown distances
      in every direction; indeed, it seems as if the whole country hereabouts
      were undermined by these ancient galleries, many of which were unexplored,
      and in some instances shunned by the peasants as haunted by evil spirits,
      and many and fantastic were the tales told of some of these caverns,
      during the summer days when wanderings about the countryside held us here
      in happy durance. It was delightful to watch the grave old men of the
      village playing bowls or skittles, and their pride over the skill which
      enabled one of them, a patriarch, to account for six pins at one shot. His
      cannoning was the very poetry of statics. As a foil the unskillful efforts
      of the present writer were not altogether unsuccessful, for they brought
      to the stolid faces of the players smiles not unkindly, but of
      considerable latitude.

      In the little "estaminet" (Spanish estamento) at the foot of the hill,
      cutlets, broiled young chicken, and a rough and cheap but good sparkling
      wine, all graced by the good humor of the proprietor, raised our content
      to enthusiasm, so we saw and studied the locality, socially and
      mythologically, to the end of its possibilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      We found that these peasants, seemingly so phlegmatic and commonplace,
      were really chimerical, and their tales and conversation skirted the
      borderland of fact and fancy. The two were so melted down and run into one
      mold as to be impossible of separation. I have listened to some of these
      tales with interest, until the splashes of golden light were gone from the
      valleys and a vast canopy of rose-shot lilac emblazoned the setting of the
      sun. In the woods hereabouts, as in other parts of this region of caverns,
      thin mysterious sounds were often audible at night to those who had ears
      to hear: the noise of a distant hunt, the sound of winding horns, the
      confused shouts of a troop of hunters, and the chime of hounds in full
      cry. Pious and superstitious peasants, listening indoors, crossed
      themselves, those who were abroad in the lanes hastened their steps, not
      glancing in the direction from which the sounds came. It was the Wild
      Chasseur. This is the story: St. Amand, Count of the Palatinate, lived
      hereabouts in the tenth century, in a great castle of which even the
      foundations have long since disappeared. He was known as a mighty hunter,
      but was a profane prince, caring naught for the worship of the Lord, nor
      the chant of the priest, but following ever the wild creatures, rather
      than the ways of truth and righteousness. There came one day in the
      autumn, and it was Sunday, long before the coming dawn disclosed the
      distant dome of the Cathedral. When this reckless count mounted his great
      horse, and at the head of an equally reckless band of merry hunters,
      started out on the chase, the great dim forests rang with the loud blasts
      of the horn, and the loud shouts of the young men broke the calm stillness
      of the holy day and scandalized the good priests, and the pious people of
      the neighborhood. Out came the noisy cavalcade into the open where four
      roads met. To them, one from the North and one from the South, and
      galloping furiously, came two horsemen; the one from the North was young,
      blonde and handsome, with an air of distinction, all clad in bright new
      cloak and bonnet of golden yellow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cavalier from the South seemed a man of temper, and was of sinister
      visage, bestriding a great horse of a temper to match that of its rider.
      His costume was of black velveteen save for his headpiece of scarlet
      cloth, which flowed scalloped down his back.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Count at the head of his troop saluted these two strangers courteously
      and invited them bear him company in the chase.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My lord," answered the rider from the North, removing his bonnet, and
      showing his fair hair in a golden mass about his shoulders, "the Sabbath
      bells are ringing in your church for the service in praise of our Lord and
      Saviour, Jesus Christ, for'tis the hour in which the voices of men in holy
      canticle are sent on high asking forgiveness of our sins and iniquities.
      This day is sanctified to Him above. I do bid you now accompany me unto
      the throne of Grace, on bended knee, in all humility.&mdash;For upon the
      offender shall descend the vengeance of the Most High, forever and ever."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In Satan's name, Sir Golden Locks!" answered St. Amand scornfully, "thou
      hast a tongue like a ranting priest. What right hast thou to wear a sword,
      pray?&mdash;I have no mind for canticles to-day!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Loud laughed the troop of cavaliers at this, and then was heard the voice
      of the rider in black from the South, whose great horse champed the bit
      and tossed its head restlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, let us away, St. Amand! What care have we for monastery bells and
      sniveling priests!&mdash;Let us to the noble chase for mass, with sound of
      the winding horn for organ note!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well said, Sir Red Crest," replied St. Amand, with a loud laugh and a
      wave of his gauntleted hand. "<i>Ventre son gris!</i> Let us away then!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole troop sprang forward at the word. Over the hills, through the
      ravines and deep ditches, and into the dark woods, ever rode the
      strangers, one at the right and one at the left of St. Amand. On the
      right, the fair young golden haired knight, and on the left, the black
      clad sinister man with the crimson hood.
    </p>
    <p>
      All at once appeared among the great trunks of the beech trees an antlered
      deer white as the driven snow, which after one startled look at the
      furiously riding troop of men, sped away like the wind. With winding horn
      the hunters pursued it over the green meadows and up and down the hills,
      trampling corn fields and peasant gardens under foot all unmindful of what
      ill they did. Naught counted for these men but the chase, and ever St.
      Amand headed the band, and on his right rode the fair young blonde rider
      from the North and on his left the swarthy knight from the South.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, with trembling limbs the antlered deer slackened its speed before
      the open door of a chapel in the midst of the wildwood. Here stood the
      frightened animal, its fur flicked with bloody foam, unable to stir a step
      further. From the open door of the chapel stepped a holy friar, who placed
      a sheltering arm about the panting animal's neck, and stood with uplifted
      arm warning back the band of hunters. In vain did the fairhaired stranger
      plead with Amand to spare the deer, for the jeering voice of the knight of
      the scarlet hood urged him on, and dismounting from his horse Count St.
      Amand pushed aside the monk and was about to run the animal through with
      his hunting knife, when there came a burst of thunder sound that shook the
      earth as though the heavens had fallen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Count was stunned: When he came to himself he was alone in a clear
      space in the forest; the chapel, the deer, the monk, all his band,
      including the two strangers, had vanished as though they had never been.
      Over all was a terrible silence. When St. Amand attempted to call, no
      sound came from his parched lips. Then came a blinding flash of lightning,
      which split the darkness, and on the wings of the rushing wind he heard a
      terrible voice in judgment.&mdash;"Even as thou hast flouted and mocked at
      the Lord thy God, and have had no compassion upon man nor beast, so shalt
      thou fly before the wrath of the Most High! Pass on then, thou accursed
      Knight, forever be thou the hunted by evil spirits until the end of the
      world!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And so," continues the legend, "since that day the wraith of that sinful
      Count St. Amand has haunted these hills and dales by night, and these
      great caverns underneath by day, the fiends of hell at his heels. After
      him fly these hideous fiends, driving him ever on towards the judgment
      that waits him on the last day."
    </p>
    <p>
      As may be surmised, with such tales as this to hold over the youth of the
      valleys, the people hereabouts were most devout and God fearing. Here in
      this region have raged battles innumerable from the earliest days of
      history, with fire, famine and pestilence. It was all prosperous, when I
      last saw it, and charming to look upon. But now the beautiful orchards
      have been cut down by the invader, the homesteads have been burned, and
      the once happy peasants transported to hard labor in another country.

    <h2>
      ST. QUENTIN
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">U</span>GLY and down at
      the heel," were the uncomplimentary terms used by an æsthetic fellow
      traveler to describe this prosperous manufacturing town situated rather
      picturesquely on a hill rising above the banks of the river Somme. And
      while it may be admitted that St. Quentin is not very clean looking when
      viewed from the railway station, certainly a later and more intimate
      inspection revealed charms which repaid leisurely investigation on our
      part, and even our first view of the gray walls and gables of the houses,
      and the quaint pinnacles of the town hall, and the tower of the church
      rising against the golden glow of the sunset sky was quite satisfying.
    </p>
    <p>
      The road to the town on the hill was by way of the Rue de l'lsle, which
      brought us to the small square on which was the flamboyant Gothic Hôtel de
      Ville. It had a most charming and unusual pent roof, over which rose a
      slender tower with large clock face shining in the sunlight. On the ground
      floor of the façade was an open arcaded gallery above which were richly
      ornamented flamboyant Gothic windows divided by niches. The upper story
      had a quaint and ornate balustrade and three gables. From the central
      gable the campanile rose gracefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      This much we were able to see on our way to the Hôtel du Cygne, the
      landlady of which gave us more comfort than our quondam traveling
      companion had led us to expect. This individual quite abandoned us to our
      fate thereafter, as impossible Yankees who gloated over picturesqueness
      and gables, and meekly ate whatever was set before them&mdash;even of an
      omelette which he scorned, and fussed about at the table d'hôte. He
      listened with a sarcastic grin to our admiring comment on the furnishings
      of the dining-room, with its paneled walls in the Flemish fashion, on
      which hung brass placques and some good old china plates, and after
      lighting a cigarette, noisily kicked back his chair, shrugged his
      shoulders, and vanished from our ken forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame told us that he was a "commis-voyageur" in the woolen trade, from
      Brussels, and "bien difficile."
    </p>
    <p>
      St. Quentin was the ancient capital of the Gaulish Veromanduens, and took
      its present name from Caius Quintinus, a priest who came here to preach
      Christianity in the third century, and for his pains was martyred by the
      Prefect Rictius Varus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Honor to his remains was encouraged by St. Eloi in the time of Dagobert.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst here we may recall that the building of the Escurial was due to a
      vow which Philip II of Spain made in case of success, when he was
      besieging St. Quentin in 1557.
    </p>
    <p>
      The town was given back to France in 1589, and in the following year was
      bestowed as a dowry upon Mary Stuart, who possessed its revenues till her
      death. On January 19, 1871, a great victory was gained near St. Quentin by
      the Prussian General Goeben over the French army of the north, * under
      Faidherbe.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Hare's "Northeastern France."
</pre>
    <p>
      In the "Place du Huit Octobre" was a very good monument by Barrias,
      symbolizing the successful defense of the town against the first attack by
      the Germans on October 8, 1870. We found that the Hôtel de Ville contained
      a most unusual "Salle du conseil," a large well proportioned room, the
      roof of which rested upon two circular wooden vaults. This was furnished
      with a most elaborate mantel or chimney piece in the mixed Gothic and
      Renaissance styles, and of remarkable workmanship. In the great German
      retreat of April, 1917, this noble building was blown up with bombs.
      Perhaps they placed upon it, as they did upon other shattered structures,
      a sign bearing the inscription: "Nicht Argern, nur Wundern."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a noble "Collegiate Church of St. Quentin" near this Hôtel de
      Ville, considered by architects to be a splendid example of French Gothic
      of the twelfth to the fifteenth centuries. This was unfortunately so shut
      in by small buildings as to make a study of it difficult. Its choir, nave,
      and portal, and its really vast height, formed unusual features, and added
      to these wonders were the beautiful triforium and terminal windows of the
      principal transept (there were two of these, "very rare in a Gothic
      church," says Hare).
    </p>
    <p>
      The oldest part of the church was easily discovered between these
      transepts. There were seven absidal chapels; in that of St. Roch was the
      incised tombstone of "Mahaus Patrelatte," dated 1272.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the choir were crypts said to have been of the ninth century, and in
      one of these was a stone sarcophagus of St. Quentin and SS. Victorious and
      Gentianus, who were St. Quentin's companions in martyrdom. The west portal
      of the church was formerly adorned with a large number of statues,
      vestiges of which were plainly visible. A statue of Quentin Delatour, a
      famous draftsman in crayon of the eighteenth century, a native of the
      town, stood before the church; it was by Lauglet the sculptor, and of
      considerable merit. A collection of Delatour's crayon drawings were in the
      small museum in the rue du Petit-Origny....
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunate St. Quentin, now once more in ashes, and this time so
      completely obliterated that nothing remains on the hill but some blackened
      ragged piles of masonry, was besieged by Philip II in 1558, when war broke
      out between Picardy and Flanders.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Philip II had landed there with an army of forty-seven thousand men, of
      whom seven thousand were English. Never did any great sovereign and great
      politician provoke and maintain for long such important wars without
      conducting them in some other fashion than from the recesses of his
      cabinet and without ever having exposed his life on the field of battle.
      The Spanish army was under the orders of Emmanuel-Philibert, Duke of
      Savoy, a young warrior of thirty, who had won the confidence of Charles V.
      He led it to the siege of St. Quentin, a place considered one of the
      bulwarks of the kingdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Philip II remained at some leagues' distance in the environs. Henry II
      was ill prepared for so serious an attack; his army, which was scarcely
      20,000 strong, mustered near Laon under orders of the Duke of Nevers,
      Governor of Champagne; at the end of July, 1557, it hurried into Picardy,
      under the command of the Constable de Montmorency, who was supported by
      Admiral de Coligny, his nephew, by the Duke of Enghien, by the Prince of
      Condé, by the Duke of Montpensier, and by nearly all the great lords and
      the valiant warriors of France. They soon saw that St. Quentin was in a
      deplorable state of defense; the fortifications were old and badly kept
      up; soldiers and munitions of war, as well as victuals were all equally
      deficient. Coligny did not hesitate, however; he threw himself into the
      place on the 2nd of August during the night with a small corps of 700 men
      and Saint Remy, a skillful engineer, who had already distinguished himself
      in the defense of Metz. The Admiral packed off the useless mouths,
      repaired the walls at the points principally threatened, and reanimated
      the failing courage of the inhabitants.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Constable and his army came within hail of the place; and d'Andelot,
      Coligny's brother, managed with great difficulty to get 450 men into it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "On the 10th of August the battle was begun between the two armies. The
      Constable affected to despise the Duke of Savoy's youth: 'I will soon show
      him,' said he, 'a move of an old soldier.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "The French army, being very inferior in numbers, was for a moment on the
      point of being surrounded. The Prince of Condë sent the Constable warning.
      'I was serving in the field,' answered Montmorency, 'before the Prince of
      Condé came into the world; I have good hopes of still giving him lessons
      in the art of war for some years to come.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "The valor of the Constable and his comrades-in-arms could not save them
      from the consequences of their stubborn recklessness, and their numerical
      inferiority; the battalions of Gascon infantry closed their ranks, with
      pikes to the front, and made a heroic resistance, but all in vain, against
      repeated charges of the Spanish cavalry; and the defeat was total.
    </p>
    <p>
      "More than 3,000 men were killed; the number of prisoners amounted to
      double this figure; and the Constable, left upon the field with his thigh
      shattered by a cannon ball, fell into the hands of the Spaniards, as was
      also the case with the Dukes of Longueville and Montpensier, la
      Rochefoucauld, d'Aubigné, etc.... The Duke of Enghien, Viscount de Turenne
      and a multitude of others, many great names amidst a host of obscure, fell
      in the fight. The Duke of Nevers and the Prince of Condé, sword in hand,
      reached La Fère with the remnants of their army. Coligny remained alone at
      St. Quentin with those who survived of his little garrison, and a hundred
      and twenty arquebusiers whom the Duke of Nevers threw into the place at a
      loss of three times as many. Coligny held out for a fortnight longer,
      behind walls that were in ruins and were assailed by a victorious army. At
      length, on the 27th of August, the enemy entered St. Quentin in shoals.

      "The Admiral, who was still going about the streets with a few men to make
      head against them, found himself hemmed in on all sides, and did what he
      could to fall into the hands of a Spaniard, preferring rather to await on
      the spot the common fate than to incur by flight any shame or reproach.
      They took him prisoner, after having set him to rest a while at the foot
      of the ramparts, and took him away to their camp, where as he entered, he
      met Captain Alonzo de Cazieres, commandant of the old bands of Spanish
      infantry; when up came the Duke of Savoy, who ordered the said Cazieres to
      take the Admiral to his tent." *

      "D'Andelot, the Admiral's brother, succeeded in escaping across the
      marshes. Being thus master of St. Quentin, Philip II, after having
      attempted to put a stop to the carnage and plunder, expelled from the
      town, which was half in ashes, the inhabitants who had survived, and the
      small adjacent fortresses of Ham and Catalet did not hesitate long before
      surrendering. Five years later, in 1557, after the battle and capture of
      St. Quentin, France was in a fit of stupor; Paris believed the enemy to be
      already beneath her walls; many of the burgesses were packing up and
      flying&mdash;some to Orleans, some to Bourges, some still further." * And
      now once more history repeats itself in the sacking and burning of this
      quaint town, in the retreat of the invader of 1914-5 after three years of
      agony endured by its people. "God makes no account of centuries, and a
      great deal is required before the most certain and most salutary truths
      get their place and their rights in the minds and communities of men,"
      says Guizot, quaintly, and thus dismisses the record of Henry II: "On the
      29th of June, 1559, a brilliant tournament was celebrated in lists erected
      at the end of the street of Saint Antoine, almost at the foot of the
      Bastile. Henry II, the Queen, and the whole court had been present at it
      for three days."

      "The entertainment was drawing to a close. The King, who had run several
      tilts 'like a sturdy and skillful Cavalier,' wished to break yet another
      lance, and bade the Count de Montgomery, captain of the guards, to run
      against him. Montgomery excused himself; but the King insisted. The tilt
      took place. The two jousters, on meeting, broke their lances skilfully;
      but Montgomery forgot to drop at once, according to usage, the fragment
      remaining in his hand; he unintentionally struck the King's helmet and
      raised the visor, and a splinter of wood entered Henry's eye; he fell
      forward upon his horse's neck."

      All the appliances of art were useless; the brain had been pierced. Henry
      II languished for eleven days and expired on the tenth of July, 1559, aged
      forty years and some months. "An insignificant man and a reign without
      splendor, though fraught with facts pregnant of grave consequences,"
      concludes the historian.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fame of Henry Martin, noted as an historian, who died in 1883, was
      commemorated by a bronze statue "such as the chimes and the great bell of
      the Collegiate erected before the Lycée," a rather handsome building in
      the Rue du Palais de Justice. Before leaving St. Quentin in April, 1917,
      the invaders shipped this statue to Germany, it is announced in the German
      press, and melted it up at the gun works with other scrap metal, "such as
      the chimes and the great bell of the Collegiate Church of St. Quentin."

      A few miles to the northeast on the river Oise was the small town of
      Guise, most picturesquely situated, and commanded by an ancient castle, or
      chateau, as these ruins are sometimes styled, which dated from the
      sixteenth century, and was occupied by a few soldiers as a sort of
      garrison. In this château in troublous times the nuns of the Guise, and
      those of the neighboring nunneries as well, took refuge. There was here,
      too, a most famous chapter of monks, but the nuns were of greater renown.
      These threw off the severe rules of St. Benedict in the twelfth century,
      and becoming "chanoinesses," lived apart with the utmost comfort, their
      abbess bearing a scepter rather than a cross. Endowed by successive ducal
      rulers, this chapter became one of the most illustrious of the province.
      "Its abbess, always chosen from a family of the most exalted rank,
      exercised almost sovereign authority over the domain, and furthermore in
      virtue of a document from the Emperor Rudolph (1290), bore the title of
      Princess of the Holy Empire. She was elected only by the united voice of
      the chapter, and went to Rome to receive consecration from the Pope
      himself in the Lateran. To him she is said to have offered in sign of
      homage, every three years, a white horse and a piece of purple velvet; and
      when after many years the Pope remitted this tax, she bore, in all solemn
      processions, a red silk banner sprinkled with gold and silver buds in
      remembrance of it. A double handed sword was carried before her in
      processions. She had the right of granting liberty to prisoners. In the
      choir of the cathedral she sat upon a throne placed upon a carpet of
      crimson velvet ornamented with gold leaves, and upon fête days she held
      'grand-couvert,' as was the custom with sovereigns. The chapter counted
      sixty-four abbesses, of whom the last in line was Louise-Adelaide de
      Bourbon-Condé." *

      Considering its part in history, it is surprising how little interest was
      taken in Guise of late years. In 1339 the English, under John of Hainault,
      burned the town, but were unable to conquer the castle, owing to the
      courageous resistance of the small body of warriors who were commanded by
      the noble lady of its absent lord, the daughter of John of Hainault
      himself. In the curious old crypt were the tombs of several abbesses, and
      the shrine contained the relics of SS. Romaric, Arnat, and Idulphe, which
      the nuns brought with them in the tenth century from the old church on the
      hill. On one of the streets were ancient houses with stone arcades.
    </p>
    <p>
      Guise was the birthplace of Camille Desmoulins, the revolutionary. Near
      the town, which was busy and prosperous, with a population of eight
      thousand or so, there was a sort of workmen's colony upon the communistic
      plan, and included a "phalanstère," or common dwelling place for the
      members, upon the Fourier plan, founded by some philanthropist. As far as
      we could judge superficially it was successful, and it is said the chance
      visitor was always welcomed most cordially by the members who happened to
      be present.
    </p>
    <p>
      These inoffensive people have been shipped away, no one now seems to be
      able to say just where, and the little town, gutted by fire, has ceased to
      exist save in the memory of those who once knew its charm.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few miles southwest of St. Quentin, on the river Somme, was a small town
      named Ham, which had, however, nothing in common with that excellent
      viand. Here was a famous château of the tenth century, of the Comtes de
      Vermondais. In 1374 it passed to the Coucy family, and then to the Comtes
      of St. Pol, from whom it came by marriage to the house of Bourbon-Vendôme.
      This great stronghold had a donjon, the walls of which were thirty-five
      feet thick, and the room inside it was one hundred and ten feet broad, and
      the same number of feet high. In shape it was a rectangle, flanked at each
      corner by a round tower, and with square towers on the north and west.
      Rising from a canal on the northeast angle was a huge round tower, named
      the Tour de Connétable, built by Louis de Luxembourg in 1490. Emblazoned
      on the stone over the portal was the motto of the founder: "Mon Myeulx"
      (My Best). The walls of this tower were said to have been of enormous
      thickness. The figures varied so much that I omit all of them, but from
      the appearance of the tower one might believe even the most exaggerated
      statements.
    </p>
    <p>
      Its lower apartment was a vast hall of hexagonal shape, the vaulting of
      which was Gothic in style, and we were shown some curious arched spaces,
      said to be intended for furnaces or magazines to be blown up and thus
      destroy the castle in case of its capture. There was a great "Salle de
      Gardes," where the soldiers slept and ate in time of siege, and this
      contained an enormous fireplace, a well of considerable depth, and an oven
      where bread had been baked. Above this vast room was the "Chambre de
      Conseil," lighted by a single large window, and furnished with stone
      benches below it. Here Jeanne d'Arc was imprisoned by Jean of Luxembourg,
      and many other notables languished in the dungeons from the time of the
      Revolution down to the time of the capture of Prince Louis Napoléon, in
      August, 1840, at Boulogne, and from which he escaped disguised as a
      workman on the morning of May 22, 1846. He took refuge at St. Quentin,
      went thence to Belgium, and finally reached England.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like all of the other great castles in the region occupied by the
      invaders, Ham was blown up before the German army "victoriously" retreated
      to the now celebrated "Hindenburg" line, in April, 1917.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE town of lace,"
      wrote William of Orange to the Estates on the 13th of April, 1677, "is
      lost to us. We are very sorry to be obliged to tell your High Mightinesses
      that it has not pleased God to bless on this occasion the arms of the
      State under our guidance." And then fell also to the troops of Louis XIV
      the towns of Cambrai, St. Omer, and the defense of Lorraine.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there is now no lace made in Valenciennes. The larger part of the
      population of twenty-eight thousand worked in the iron foundries and the
      great machine shops surrounding the town, from which clouds of soft coal
      smoke rose, reminding one of our own Pittsburgh, but with the addition of
      much quaint antiquity, which was now (1910) unhappily rapidly disappearing
      through lack of interest on the part of not only the inhabitants but the
      authorities, whom one would think alive to their value as an attraction to
      the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      Formerly strongly fortified and most powerful, this quaint semi-Flemish
      town, which was now given over thus to prosaic manufacture, was situated
      at the junction of the rivers Scheldt and Rhondelle. There were huge, ugly
      sugar factories as well as iron mills, indeed,'tis said that nearly all
      the sugar used in France was produced here.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like all Flemish towns, Valenciennes had a good deal of drunkenness to
      contend with on the part of its working people, but I must confess I saw
      little of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is said that Valentinian I, Roman Emperor, gave name to the town, which
      was at first the capital of a small independent principality. Later it
      passed into the hands of the Counts of Hainault; suffered and resisted
      sieges by Margaret of Hainault in 1254; by Louis XI, in 1477; by Turenne,
      in 1656; and by the Spaniards in the seventeenth century; and by Scherer
      in 1794. Since the treaty of Nymegen in 1678 it has belonged to France.
    </p>

      A great many celebrated men were born at Valenciennes, and all about the
      statue of Froissart their effigies are arranged in a series of medallions.
      Among these are Antoine, Louis and François Watteau, Pujol, the painters,
      Lemaire and Carpeaux, the sculptors, and Charles, Sire de Lannoy and
      Viceroy of Naples&mdash;all natives of the little town. Madame d'Epinay,
      the author, also was born here.
    </p>
    <p>
      Valenciennes had a most attractive and picturesque square, which occupied
      the former glacis of the ancient fortifications demolished about twenty
      years ago, and there was a handsome street, called the Rue de Ferrand,
      upon which was the "Lycée," formerly a Jesuit college, and the Ecole des
      Beaux Arts, in which was a museum of natural history, containing a fine
      collection of minerals of which the townspeople were inordinately proud.
      They quite ignored the value of a splendid collection of MSS., numbering
      nearly a thousand examples of mediaeval workmanship, contained in the
      Municipal Library, occupying part of the old Jesuit college. The custode
      wrung his hands in despair at the indifference of the authorities to its
      importance, and became positively and alarmingly affectionate over me when
      I showed enthusiasm for some of the specimens, so that I had to place
      myself behind one of the cases where he could not well reach me while I
      examined the illuminations. There was a fine statue of Antoine Watteau,
      the painter, by the sculptor Carpeaux, with four figures grouped about it
      representing Italian comedy. (This statue, I am informed, was shipped to
      Germany by the invaders in 1916, to be melted up and cast into cannon. An
      irreparable loss, as it was considered one of the finest examples of the
      work of Carpeaux.)
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Square was the ancient Church of St. Géry, a remarkable example of
      Gothic workmanship dating from the thirteenth century, and much studied
      and valued by architects. In its choir were fine wood carvings
      illustrating events in the life of St. Norbert, who was the founder of the
      Præmonstratensian order. The handsome and noteworthy Place d'Armes
      contained some most quaint and ancient timber dwellings, which were dated
      variously during the seventeenth century, and in an astonishingly fine
      state of preservation. But by far the most interesting building in
      Valenciennes was the Hôtel de Ville, which though lately restored (1868),
      dated from the seventeenth century, the period of the Spanish occupation.
      The façade was quite imposing, consisting of a row of Doric columns,
      upholding a row of Ionic columns, which supported a number of caryatides
      and a sort of open gallery above. Carpeaux designed the sculptures
      ornamenting the pediment, which represented the Defense of Valenciennes.

      This building was occupied by the Musée of Paintings and Sculpture, which
      was really one of the most important and extensive collections in France
      of examples of the Flemish school of painting. Here I saw in 1910 a large
      number of beautiful original drawings, and a collection of Flemish
      tapestries of incalculable value. There were nine or ten rooms devoted to
      the Flemish masters, and to mention only a few of the treasures they
      contained, I note here: "Hell-fire"; Breughel, Toil Devoured by Usury;
      Jordaens, Twelfth Night; Van Balen, Rope of Europa; P. A. da Cortona,
      Herodias; Seghers, St. Eloi and the Virgin; Neets, the younger, Church
      Interior; Vinckboons, Forest; Van Aelst, Still Life; Van Mieris, Pan and
      Syrinx; Al. Adriensis, Fish Merchant; Van Goyen, Landscape; "Velvet"
      Breughel, Landscape; Van de Velde, Sea Piece; Van Oost, Adoration of the
      Shepherds; Pourbus (younger), Marie de Medicis; Brouwer, Tavern Scene;
      Wouverman, Hunters; Teniers, Interior of Grotto; Rubens, Descent from the
      Cross; Guido (?), St. Peter; Metsys, Banker and His Wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fate of this remarkable collection of Flemish and Spanish paintings is
      at present shrouded in mystery. It is said, and denied variously, that
      they were removed to Paris before the German army arrived. I understand
      from reports in the newspapers, which may or may not be authentic, that
      this old Hôtel de Ville was entirely destroyed by British shells early in
      the war, and that the venerable Maison du Prévost, built during the
      Spanish invasion, and the old timbered and slated houses at the corner of
      the Grand' Place, one of them occupied by the "Café Modeste," have been
      entirely destroyed. But at present (May, 1917) Valenciennes is behind the
      curtain of mystery drawn over its miseries by the Germans.
    </p>
    <p>
      This little town played a small part in the peace of Cambrai, called the
      "Ladies' peace," in honor of the Princesses who while at Valenciennes had
      negotiated it there between Charles V and Francis I. "Two women, Francis
      I's mother and Charles V's aunt, Louise of Savoy, and Margaret of Austria,
      had the real negotiation of it; they had both of them acquired the good
      sense and the moderation which come from experience of affairs and from
      the difficulties in life; they did not seek to give one another mutual
      surprises and to play off one another reciprocally. They resided in two
      contiguous houses, between which they caused a communication to be made
      from the inside, and they conducted the negotiation with so much
      discretion that the petty Italian princes who were interested in it did
      not know the results of it until peace was concluded on the 5th of August,
      1529.... These women, though morally different and of very unequal social
      status, both had minds of a rare order, trained to recognize political
      necessities and not to attempt any but possible successes. They did not
      long survive their work; Margaret of Austria died on the 1st of December,
      1530, and Louise of Savoy on the 22nd of September, 1531." *

    <p>
      This peace lasted until 1536; incessantly troubled, however, by far from
      pacific symptoms, proceedings and preparations, but it was certainly a
      monument to the skill of these two princesses. Charles V, on his way
      through the kingdom, after passing a week at Paris, pushed on to
      Valenciennes, the first town in his Flemish dominions, where he rested in
      state. When his eyes rested upon all the wealth and cheerful industry that
      surrounded him here, he said (according to Brantôme), "There is not in
      this world any greatness such as that of a King of France."
    </p>
    <p>
      Valenciennes, when I saw it before the outbreak of the great war in 1914,
      was a rather sleepy little town given over to most prosaic manufactures.
      There was little evident picturesqueness; most of the ancient buildings
      had given way to stupid looking stucco covered houses. In vain did my Lady
      Anne seek the lace makers; they were not to be found&mdash;if they
      existed. There were no bric-a-brac or antique shops, either, wherein one
      might browse, but there was a quaint and most comfortable hotel, presided
      over by a garrulous landlord whose (artful) innocence and unworldliness
      quite took us in, and whose bill, when presented, proved to be fifty per
      cent more than we had reckoned upon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Valenciennes should have been an economical town to live in, but it was
      not so; at least in the delightful hotel, which was so well kept and
      apparently so clean. The day following our arrival two charwomen started
      at the top of the house with buckets of water and scrubbing brushes. The
      buckets, by the way, were not the ordinary iron ones, but immense affairs
      of rough earthenware of a rich buff color outside, and a most delicious
      bright green enamel inside. The women scrubbed the floors from attic to
      back door&mdash;except the parquet floors&mdash;ignoring the corners, for
      cleanliness comes evidently very near to godliness in these semi-Flemish
      towns of Northern France; they are not very thorough. Following these
      bare-armed amazons came the housemaid with a great cake of beeswax, which
      was fixed into a fork of wood at the end of the handle as long and thick
      as a broomstick. With this beeswax she rubbed the floor most energetically
      until the grain of the old oak floor came out clearly. Then followed the
      polisher with a large, thick, flat brush made in the form of a sort of
      sandal which was fastened to one foot by a wide strap of leather, the
      brushless foot was kept stationary; the other with deft slides backwards
      and forwards produced a most beautiful polish like varnish. There were few
      carpets to be found anywhere, and in the summer one did not miss them, but
      I should imagine that the houses would be very damp and cold in the
      winter, when there is little provision made for heating these old drafty
      rooms, and (if one might consider expense) wood for the grate fires is
      charged for at the rate of "F. 1.25 per basket of nine sticks." (Per
      published tariff.)
    </p>
    <p>
      We were told that the proper way to study this part of the country is to
      take a small house for the summer. One could furnish cheaply here, it was
      urged, in the country style, no carpets, and with the furniture made
      hereabouts.
    </p>
    <p>
      My Lady Anne was quite taken with the idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      The furniture was in good taste, stained a dark brown; it made a charming
      foil for the bright yellows and pale greens of the crockery.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bedrooms had alcoves for the beds, with a curious little door cut out
      of the wooden partition wall at the back of the bed: this was for the
      convenience of the housemaid, as it saved the necessity of pulling out the
      bed to get behind it. These walls were almost always made of boards, and
      thus the doors were easily cut, so that covered with wall paper one
      scarcely ever noticed them.
    </p>
    <p>
      My Lady Anne discovered that the clothing sent to be washed was, unless
      otherwise ordered, sent home rough dried! Ironing is special. Following
      the custom here there was no weekly washing day, but washing was done once
      a month or even two months, and this is the reason why there were so many
      of the really fine oak or chestnut armoirs to be found. Some of these were
      most beautiful, made of polished wood, and had often unique brass hinges
      and locks. Every household had one or more, in spite of the fact that the
      dealers were on the quest for them. The peasants who lived off the beaten
      track of travel willingly parted with them for comparatively small prices.
      We thought it rather extraordinary to find in a poor laborer's cottage a
      specimen of these fine chests fit for the hall of a millionaire collector.
      There were also fine wardrobes to be found, with handsomely carved
      chestnut or applewood panels polished like glass, and with brass knobs and
      locks worn bright with the use of many generations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Occasionally one could find the old fashioned double decked bed made of
      dark oak, and the long heavy Norman table, which was the household larder,
      for in its long and deep drawer were generally stored the household
      provisions of ham, bacon, or dried fish; never the bread, though, for this
      was kept overhead upon a well polished board, in the older houses, hung
      from the ceiling, well out of the way of the rats, the torment of the
      peasant. In these houses the clothes were hung on ropes high up against
      the sloping roofs to prevent these pests from gnawing them. The broken
      necks of bottles were fastened at the ends of these cords or ropes, and on
      these the rats jumped from the rafters and went spinning over onto the
      floor far beneath. In all the villages there were public washing pools, a
      feature of the country. No washing was done in the cottages. Hundreds of
      peasant women washed the clothes, kneeling in long lines at the sides of
      the streams, keeping up all the time a chattering and laughing that could
      be heard from a distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes there were shelters overhead for their protection from sun and
      rain, sometimes not. They washed the clothes on flat boards, and beat them
      when lathered with a flat wooden sort of paddle. The washing was well done
      too, surprising to tell, but although they say not, one would think that
      the process was rather hard upon the clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      These quaint customs quite charmed us, and we were inclined to shut our
      eyes to certain evidences of drunkenness and its accompanying sins among
      the lower classes which could not be concealed, and which perhaps need not
      be entered into here.
    </p>
    <p>
      Valenciennes was a manufacturing town, and the condition of the artisan
      classes was said to be even worse than that in Belgium just over the
      border. The hours of labor were long&mdash;unquestionably too long&mdash;and
      said to be as a rule fixed by the employer. Children of tender age were
      employed in factory and warehouse, and this perhaps explains the stunted
      appearance of the poor people. The law says that no child under sixteen
      can be kept at work for more than twelve hours a day, but it is understood
      that this law was easily evaded. The result was inevitable. If the child
      could be kept at work for twelve hours a day, then it will be understood
      that an adult was assumed to be able to do more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course the man did not really work as hard as our own men do, and that
      he did piece work, and also that a considerable portion of his time must
      be deducted for shirking, for gossip and for rest. Still, at the foundries
      the hours and the labor were both excessive. The thought had not occurred
      to these manufacturers and proprietors that a man might do more in sixty
      hours a week than he will do in seventy. The terrible "Borinage" district
      of the mines of Belgium, which extends as far west as Quevrain on the
      border, really runs over the line, and some of its conditions existed at
      Blanc Misseron, Fresnes, and at Bruay. The name "Borinage" signifies the
      place of boring. Here was to be found a state of society that does not
      exist in any other part of the country, and the miners and their wretched
      families were a type quite distinct from all the rest of their countrymen.
      By the character of their work and by the deficiencies or lack of
      education, supplemented by the poisonous effects of the fiery and
      deleterious potato brandy and other decoctions which they freely imbibe,
      they had sunk into a state of both physical and mental decay.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A visit to these places is not a pleasant experience, and the closer the
      acquaintance made with the life of the mining population the less
      attractive does it appear. The employment of children of tender years lies
      at the root of the ignorance of the people of the province.... To the
      proprietors, with rare exceptions, the miners are mere beasts of burden,
      in whom they do not feel the least interest. No steps whatever are taken
      to improve the lot of the miners, to elevate their ideas, or even to
      provide them with amusement or recreations.... The only places of resort
      are the 'Estaminets' and cabarets that are to be found in every third or
      fourth house.... It is scarcely going too far to say that morality does
      not exist in the Borinage; but the great curse in this community is the
      large number of immature mothers, and the consequent inseparable
      deterioration of the whole race.... Ignorance and immorality explain the
      low condition to which the mining population has sunk, but even these
      causes would not have produced such an appalling result if they had not
      been supplemented by the prevalence of drunkenness. As there is no
      restriction upon the sale of drink, every house may retail intoxicating
      liquors, and in many places where it is procurable there is no external
      appearance of the place being a drinking shop. The room of the cottage
      will contain a few chairs and benches, besides a table, and the liquor
      comes from a cupboard or an inner room. In warm weather the table and
      chairs are placed outside, and on Sundays and feast days there is not one
      of these houses which will not be crowded with visitors. The only
      amusement known to these people is to drink and to get drunk.... The beer
      drinkers are the more reasonable drunkards of the two. Having soaked
      themselves with 'faro' (a thin sour beer) they sleep it off. Not so the
      spirit drinkers, for when they have finished their orgies they are half
      mad with the poisonous alcohol which they have imbibed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The true explanation of the evils that follow this spirit drinking is to
      be found in the character of the spirit itself. In name it is gin or
      'genievre,' but it bears little or no trace of that origin. What it is, no
      one outside the place of manufacture&mdash;which appears to be unknown&mdash;can
      correctly declare, but by the smell it would seem to be mainly composed of
      paraffin oil. This beverage is called 'Schnick' and is the favorite spirit
      of the miners. It is sold for ten centimes (1 penny) for a large wine
      glass, and five centimes (1/2 penny) for a small, and official statistics
      show that a large majority of the miners drink a pint of this stuff every
      day of their lives, while it is computed that there are no fewer than
      fifty thousand who drink a quart.... Lest the reader should imagine that
      there is some exaggeration in the figures just given, it may be mentioned
      that the total consumption of spirits per head of the population (of
      Belgium) exceeds fifty quarts." *

      This is, of course, written of Belgium, but as this mining country extends
      beyond the border into France, as I have said, these conditions exist in
      the neighboring villages to the north and east of Valenciennes. It is a
      relief to turn from this terrible picture to the vistas southwards, but it
      is only just to add that the Belgian Government was doing its best to
      cleanse this region when the war broke out and put a stop to the work.
    </p>
    <p>
      How could the people who dwell in this terrible spot be other than
      debased? Conditions were all against them. World welfare demands the
      product of the mines; so workers are automatically produced to supply it,
      and thus across this fair land stretches this great black belt, like a
      vast unhealed wound, that extends from the western boundaries of Picardy,
      far beyond the German Westphalian province, and digs deep into the bowels
      of the earth, its presence being detected from afar by the heavy clouds of
      pungent, evil smelling black and brown smoke of the furnaces, as one
      approaches, and by the great heaps of clay and ashes along the railway
      lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the territory coveted by the "war lord." This is the road to the
      Channel, and over this strip by day and by night fall the shells of the
      invaders and defenders alike.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gone now are the peaceful farmsteads; the quaint old villages clustered
      about the gray towers of the churches and monasteries, and the many
      towered, white walled châteaux in the vine clad gardens. The quiet towns
      and villages which we explored in those memorable summer days of 1910 are
      swept from the face of the earth, and there are now long level wide roads
      stretching towards and into the horizon, upon which the whole day and
      night, two mighty lines of silent armed men linking together heavy wagons
      and immense shapeless masses of heavy guns and tractors, to and from the
      fighting lines, form endless processions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The God of Efficiency in destruction now reigns where once peaceful thrift
      was enthroned.

      SOISSONS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">B</span>OTH Abelard and
      Thomas à Becket are identified with this venerable fortress town, which
      was lately noted for its haricot-beans, and whose people, steeped in trade
      with Paris, were entirely oblivious to the value and beauty of the great
      cathedral of Notre Dame, SS. Gervais and Protais, the equal of which was
      perhaps not in all France.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Abelard was imprisoned in a tower which was shown, to those who
      sought it out, by a lame old priest. This tower was surmounted by a small
      chapel; it contained nothing, however, which was identified with the
      prisoner. There was also to be seen the ancient Abbey of St. Jean des
      Vignes, in which Thomas à Becket "spent nine years." The chief and most
      interesting part of this was the west façade or "portail," in the style of
      the thirteenth century, and flanked by a great tower more than 200 feet
      high, some say 225 feet, which could be seen from a great distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The approach to the town by way of the river bank was all that could be
      desired for picturesqueness, and above the trees and the quaint red tiled
      roofs of the many gabled houses, the great tower of the venerable
      cathedral lifted its heavy gray mass against a fleecy sky. The river was
      full of quaintly fashioned barges, and heavily built boats with huge
      rudders painted with stripes of vivid green and red, something like those
      on the Maas in Holland. Here and there a small black steamer belched forth
      pungent sooty smoke, and there seemed to be a great deal of business going
      on all about, and an air of prosperity and alertness, entirely out of
      keeping in so venerable a town, and which one could not decide to be quite
      as it should be or not. There were modern shops also with windows dressed
      quite <i>à la Paris</i>, and a good hostelry, the <i>Lion Rouge</i>, where
      one was made extraordinarily comfortable for a rather small sum. The
      streets were filled with quaint and unusual characters, and now and again
      we saw costumes and some headdresses on the peasant women that we had not
      seen elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      An old traveler writing of Soissons said: "At a small inn, 'Des Trois
      Pucelles,' I had a noble salmon, that still excites emotions in me when I
      think of it. I have never met with its like since&mdash;and there was also
      venison, a whole haunch brought to table, and claret the like of which
      would grace the king's table."
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked for "Des Trois Pucelles," but alas, it had been pulled down long
      since.

      In this pleasant town, one might have lingered indefinitely and not lacked
      entertainment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soissons was called Augusta Suessionum under the early Empire. The town
      has great notoriety among historians for the great number of sieges it has
      undergone, down to the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, when for three days it
      resisted all attempts to take it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Pépin le Bref was proclaimed King, and Louis le Débonnaire's
      undutiful sons imprisoned him in the Abbey of S. Medard.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the beginning of the eleventh century to the middle of the fourteenth
      century, Soissons was ruled by its hereditary counts, but one of these,
      Louis de Chatil-lon, who fell at the battle of Crécy, being imprisoned in
      England, to pay his ransom, sold his countship to En-guerrand VII de Coucy
      in 1367, and with all the rest of the appanage of Coucy, it was taken by
      the crown of Louis XII.
    </p>
    <p>
      From Cæsar to Napoleon its importance from a military point of view has
      been of the greatest value from its splendid position on the banks of the
      river Aisne. For centuries it had to defend itself from continued attacks,
      and in these, although many times successful, the stronghold seems to have
      worn down to its walls and towers. It has been called by historians "The
      City of Sieges," and certainly few towns seem to have suffered more.
      Doubtless its magnificent strategic position on the river Aisne has been
      the reason for the successive attacks upon it. It was also a favorite seat
      of royalty, and the capital of a Roman king, Syagrius. Architects have
      pronounced the Cathedral's interior even more impressive than that of
      Rheims, and say that "the beautiful proportions of the nave, the
      simplicity and purity of the carved capitals, the splendid glass, rendered
      it one of the most beautiful cathedrals of France." ("Cathedral Cities of
      France," Herbert Marshall.)
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a splendid example of mixed Romanesque and Gothic of the twelfth
      and thirteenth centuries. The west façade had three beautiful doors, and a
      great rose window of Gothic design containing glass, the equal of which
      cannot, in the writer's opinion, be found in all France. There is a great
      square tower on the south side, terminating in an apse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inside, I saw some tapestry of the fifteenth century in good condition,
      and the sacristan showed an "Adoration of the Shepherds," which he
      attributed to Rubens, but it was so badly lighted that little of the
      detail could be seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soissons suffered much at the hands of the Germans during the
      Franco-Prussian War of 1870, when it was besieged by a force under the
      command of the Duke of Mecklenburg, whose soldiers burned and destroyed to
      their hearts' content.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even as late as 1910, when I visited the town, the sacristan of the
      Cathedral, in response to a question as to his knowledge of the siege,
      became quite incoherent in his denunciations of the enemy. One wonders
      what has become of this cultured and delightful old man, who was at once
      priest and patriot. The south transept is said to have been the oldest
      part of the Cathedral, and here was the sacristy (dated the end of the
      twelfth century). The sacristan showed us the choir (1212) which was
      surrounded by eight square, and the apse by five chapels of polygonal
      form. Of these "Fergusson" says, "Nothing can exceed the justness of the
      proportions of the center and side aisles, both in themselves and to one
      another."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kneeling statues of the abbesses, Marie de la Rochefoucauld and Henriette
      de Lorraine d'Elbeuf were placed at either side of the west portal. These
      were from the royal abbey of Notre Dame, but the sacristan could not, or
      at any rate did not, give me any other information concerning them. In the
      west end was a lovely little chapel, in what is called the "Salle
      capit-ulaire," entrance to which is through an early Gothic cloister with
      graceful vaulting supported by two beautiful columns.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very little remained of the once magnificent Abbey of St. Jean des Vignes,
      except two spires, and a ruined façade, and this is on an eminence near
      the station. In the bombardment of the town during the Franco-Prus-sian
      War these were greatly damaged, but not destroyed. Here Thomas à Becket
      lived in 1170. Some of the remaining buildings were being used as a
      military prison in 1910.
    </p>
    <p>
      The beautiful remains of the royal abbey of Notre Dame were given over to
      the authorities as a soldiers' barracks, and admission to the premises was
      refused us at the gate by a sentry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Behind the Cathedral was the Hôtel de Ville, which contained the Library
      and the Museum, neither of which was impressive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Near the royal abbey of Notre Dame was the old Tour Lardier, in which,
      according to legend, Satan was put in chains and confined by St. Vaast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside the town, to the north, was the ruined church of St.
      Crepin-en-Chaye, where in an abbey built in the eleventh century, the
      Saints Crepinien were burned at the stake as martyrs. The abbots of old
      were certainly militant personages, and their castles were strongholds. We
      saw the remains of the abbey of St. Medard, which is said to have been
      founded in 560 by Clotaire I. Here the Kings Clotaire and Sigebert were
      buried, and here Childeric III was deposed; Pépin of Heristal received his
      crown, and Louis le Débonnaire imprisoned by his heartless sons in 833.
      Abelard, condemned at the Council of Soissons, was confined here for
      years.

      The monastery was one of the richest in France, holding an appanage of two
      hundred and fifty villages, including manor houses and farmsteads. A
      warrior abbot headed one hundred and fifty armed vassals at the Battle of
      Bouvines.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the seven churches of St. Medard nothing remained, and the site was
      occupied by some nondescript buildings used as some sort of charitable
      institution.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a crypt under the chapel of the abbey church we were shown a large
      stone coffin, alleged to be that of Clotaire, and a small vault contains a
      cell in which the unfortunate Louis le Débonnaire languished. There is an
      inscription supporting this as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      "Hélas, je suys bons prins des douleurs

      Of the genuineness of this inscription some authorities are doubtful, but
      I include it here, nevertheless.
    </p>
    <p>
      This whole region is now hidden behind the mask of smoke and mystery of
      the present infernal war.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just what ruin lies behind this dropped curtain is uncertain. It has been
      reported that Soissons is in ashes, burned and sacked in revenge for the
      failure of the Verdun attack. At any rate its inhabitants are confined
      within the limits of the town, and it is understood that they are
      compelled to toil unceasingly for the invaders. The vast farmsteads and
      fields are understood to be worked to the utmost by the townspeople in
      regular "gangs" under the eyes of German officers, and that the crops have
      been regularly gathered and distributed under the remarkable system for
      which the Germans are noted. Other than these no details have been allowed
      to creep forth from this unfortunate town. That this sanctuary of
      architecture may perchance escape entire destruction at the hands of these
      barbarians is not too much to hope for, but that the Cathedral should be
      spared is inconceivable, when one remembers the fate of Rheims, Ypres,
      Louvain, Arras, Malines and Noyon, to mention but a few of the
      incomparable treasures that have vanished before their onslaught.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soissons' magnificent monuments are now probably heaps of calcined stone
      and charred beams. Those marvels of painted glass will live henceforth
      only in the memory of those whose good fortune it was to have seen and
      valued them.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I write this the Cathedral of Lâon is reported to be a wreck, and is
      thus added to the list. Words fail me.
    </p>
    <p>
      These "murdered cities" are glorified forever more....
    </p>
    <p>
      How one's imagination responds to their very names: Verdun, Amiens,
      Soissons, Rheims, Arras, Valenciennes!&mdash;and those others of Flanders:
      Bruges, Ghent, Louvain, Malines, Lille and Ypres&mdash;how full are these
      of grace and fancy. What ring of shield!&mdash;What clang of arms!
    </p>
    <p>
      For forty years these towns have enjoyed peace and fancied security, while
      that once great power, with hypocritical words of good will towards all
      men, even while sending delegates to the conferences at The Hague, was
      deliberately planning the destruction of sleeping nations whose lands are
      now invaded; whose young manhood is disappearing in a storm of blood and
      iron; whose architectural treasures are now but smoldering heaps of ashes!
    </p>
    <p>
      Rheims Cathedral, it is urged, was a landmark; a menace to the invader;&mdash;and
      this is true. It was a landmark, most certainly, and therefore it was a
      menace to the army of the invader, and was destroyed. This fact
      established, there followed the destruction of the other cathedrals, and
      it may be that before the invader is beaten off and pushed back over his
      own boundary line, those other great works of art still untouched will
      vanish under the rain of fire and shell&mdash;and none remain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such a catastrophe is appalling, and it may be realized before the war is
      over, for there is small reason why all should not suffer the fate of
      great St. Martin's at Ypres, and Rheims, at the hands of the descendants
      of the Huns and the Allemanni. As it is now six great cathedral towns lie
      inclosed within their iron clad battle lines&mdash;Soissons, Lâon, Senlis,
      Amiens, Noyon and Rheims; of these Rheims, Soissons, Noyon and Senlis have
      been ruined; Amiens remains (so we are told) intact. No such assurance is
      given of Lâon, with its wonderful square ended choir, the only one in
      France, and the remarkable effigies of oxen, carved in stone, on the tops
      of the twin towers.

      was born here in 1592, and a monument to him by the sculptor Mohlknecht
      was placed on the promenade in 1851.

      Just what the invaders have done to this sleepy, peaceful, little town,
      can not at this writing be ascertained, but it is reported that the great
      towers of the cathedral have been shot away, and that most of the town is
      a mass of shapeless debris. Mr. Ralph Adams Cram, the eminent architect
      who has made a study of the cathedral, says in his scholarly and informing
      book ("The Heart of Europe," p. 99), "The ancient cathedral was burned in
      1131, and the present work begun shortly after, though it is hard to
      believe that much of the existing structure antedates the year 1150. The
      crossing and transepts date from about 1170, and the nave ten years later,
      while the west front and towers are of the early part of the next century.
      The certainty and calm assurance of the work is remarkable. Paris, which
      is later, is full of tentative experiments, but there is no halting here,
      rather a severe certainty of touch that is perfectly convincing.... In
      1293 the whole town was destroyed by fire, and the cathedral wrecked; but
      it was immediately reconstructed, however; and at this time the sexpartite
      gave place to the quadripartite vaulting, while the west front with its
      great towers, very noble in their proportions and their powerful
      buttressing, was completed."

    <p>
      From the earliest days Noyon in common with its neighboring towns seems to
      have had a hard time of it, whether in war or peace. The communes
      constantly fought with each other, the ancient burghers of Noyon being at
      daily loggerheads with the established metropolitan clergy. A certain
      Baudri de Larchainville, a native of Artois who had the title of chaplain
      of the bishopric, "a man of wise and reflecting mind" who did not share
      the violent aversion felt by most of his order for the existing
      institutions of communes, realized that sooner or later all would have to
      bow to authority, and that it was better to surrender to the wishes of the
      citizens than to shed blood in order to postpone an unavoidable
      revolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elected Bishop of Noyon in 1098, he found this town in the same state of
      unrest and insurrection as Cambrai. The registers of the church contained
      a host of documents entitled "Peace Made between Us and the Burghers of
      Noyon."
    </p>
    <p>
      But no reconciliation was lasting. "The truce was soon broken either by
      the clergy or by the citizens, who were the more touchy in that they had
      less security for their persons and their property."
    </p>
    <p>
      The new bishop believed that the establishment of a commune sworn to by
      both the rival parties might become a sort of compact of alliance between
      them, and he set about realizing this noble idea before the word commune
      had served at Noyon as the rallying cry of popular insurrection.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of his own mere motion he convoked in assembly all the inhabitants of the
      town, clergy, knights, traders, and craftsmen. He presented them with a
      charter which constituted the body of burghers, an association forever
      under magistrates called <i>Jurymen</i>, like those of Cambrai.
      'Whosoever,' said the charter, 'shall desire to enter this commune shall
      not be able to be received as a member of it by a single individual, but
      only in the presence of the Jurymen. The sum of money he shall then give
      shall be employed for the benefit of the town, and not for the private
      advantage of any one whatsoever. If the commune be outraged, all those who
      have sworn to it shall be bound to march to its defense, and none shall be
      empowered to remain at home unless he be infirm or sick, or so poor that
      he must needs be himself the watcher of his own wife and children lying
      sick. If any one have wounded or slain any one on the territory of the
      commune, the Jurymen shall take vengeance therefor.'" The other articles
      guarantee to the members of the commune of Noyon the complete ownership of
      their property, and the right of not being handed over to justice save
      before their own municipal magistrates. The bishop first swore to this
      charter, and the inhabitants of every condition took the same oath after
      him. In virtue of his pontifical authority he pronounced the anathema, and
      all the curses of the Old and New Testament, against whoever should in
      time to come try to dissolve the commune or infringe its regulations.
      Furthermore, in order to give this new pact a stronger warranty, Baudri
      requested the King of France, Louis the Fat, to corroborate it, as they
      used to say at the time, by his approbation and by the great seal of the
      Crown. The King consented to this request of the bishop, and that was all
      the part taken by Louis the Fat in the establishment of the Commune of
      Noyon.

      The King's Charter is not preserved but, under the date of 1108, there is
      extant one of the bishop's own, which may serve to substantiate the
      account given. "Baudri, by the grace of God, bishop of Noyon, to all those
      who do persevere and go on in the faith:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Most dear brethren, we learn by the example and words of the holy
      Fathers, that all good things ought to be committed to writing for fear
      lest hereafter they come to be forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Know then all Christians present and to come, that I have formed at Noyon
      a commune, constituted by the council and in an assembly of clergy,
      knights and burghers; that I have confirmed it by oath, by pontifical
      authority and by the bond of anathema, and that I have prevailed upon our
      lord King Louis to grant this commune and corroborate it with the King's
      Seal. This establishment formed by me, sworn to by a great number of
      persons, and granted by the King, let none be so bold as to destroy or
      alter; I give warning thereof, on behalf of God and myself, and I forbid
      it in the name of Pontifical Authority.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whosoever shall transgress and violate the present law, be subjected to
      excommunication; and whosoever, on the contrary, shall faithfully keep it,
      be preserved forever amongst those who dwell in the house of the Lord."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus was formed the Commune of Noyon in the year of our Lord 1108.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of the eleventh century the town had become one of the most
      important in the kingdom, filled with rich and industrious inhabitants;
      thither came, as to Lâon, the neighboring people for provisions or
      diversion; and such concourse led to many disturbances. Thierry says, "The
      nobles and their servitors, sword in hand, committed robbery upon the
      burghers; the streets of the town were not safe by night or even by day,
      and none could go out without running a risk of being stopped and robbed
      or killed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let me give as example," says Guibert of Nogent, "a single fact, which
      had it taken place amongst the Barbarians or Scythians, would assuredly
      have been considered the height of wickedness, in the judgment even of
      those who recognize no law. On Saturday the inhabitants of the country
      places used to leave their fields, and come from all sides to get
      provisions at the market. The townsfolk used then to go round the place
      carrying in baskets or bowls or otherwise, samples of vegetables or grain
      or any other article, as if they wished to sell. They would offer them to
      the first peasant who was in search of such things to buy; he would
      promise to pay the price agreed upon; then the seller would say to the
      buyer, 'Come with me to my house to see and examine the whole of the
      articles I am selling you.' The other would go; and then when they came to
      the bin containing the goods, the <i>honest</i> seller would take off and
      hold up the lid, saying to the buyer, 'Step hither and put your head or
      arms into the bin to make quite sure that it is exactly the same goods as
      I showed you outside.' And then when the other unsuspecting, jumping on to
      the edge of the bin, remained leaning on his belly, with his head and
      shoulders hanging down, the worthy seller, who kept in the rear, would
      hoist up the thoughtless rustic by the feet, push him suddenly into the
      bin, and clapping down the lid as he fell, keep him shut up in this safe
      prison until he <i>bought</i> himself out."
    </p>
    <p>
      This story, told of the Commune of Lâon, formed in imitation of that at
      Noyon, was typical of all such communities. Lâon elected one Gaudri, a
      Norman by birth, referendary of Henry I, King of England, and one of those
      churchmen who according to Thierry's expression, "had gone in the train of
      William the Bastard to seek their fortunes amongst the English by seizing
      the property of the vanquished." Of scarcely edifying life, he had the
      tastes and habits of a soldier; was hasty and arrogant; a fighter and also
      something of a glutton. He met at Langres Pope Pascal II, come to France
      to keep the festival of Christmas at the Abbey of Cluny. The Pope had
      heard of his reputation, for afterwards he asked the ecclesiastics who
      accompanied Gaudri, "why they had chosen a man unknown to them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The question being asked in Latin, none of the priests knew even the
      rudiments of the tongue, so they could not answer," (says Guibert de
      Nogent, who records the matter).
    </p>
    <p>
      Gaudri certainly was scantily fitted for the bishopric, as the town soon
      discovered. "Scarcely had he been installed when he committed strange
      outrages. He had a man's eyes put out on suspicion of connivance with his
      enemies; and he tolerated the murder of another in the metropolitan
      church. In imitation of rich crusaders on their return from the East, he
      kept a black slave, whom he employed upon his deeds of vengeance. The
      burghers began to be disquieted and to wax wroth. So a commune was
      resolved upon like that at Noyon, and was speedily set up and proclaimed,
      to the manifest wrath of Gaudri, who for days abstained from entering the
      town. But the burghers, craftily acting upon his cupidity and
      avariciousness, 'offered him so large a sum of money as to appease the
      tempest of his words,' so he accepted the commune and swore to respect it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For the space of three years all went well, and the burghers were happy
      and proud of the liberty they enjoyed, but when in 1112 the Bishop had
      spent the money thus received, he meditated over and keenly regretted the
      power thus bartered away, and resolved to return the townspeople to the
      old condition of serfdom. Consulting with King Louis the Fat, he won his
      consent to the plan he had in mind, by promising him untold sums of
      money."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Charter, sealed with the King's Seal, was annulled; and on the part of
      the King and the Bishop an order was issued to all the magistrates of the
      commune to cease from their functions, to give up the seal and the banner
      of the town, to ring no longer the belfry chimes which rang out the
      opening and closing of their audiences.
    </p>
    <p>
      But at this proclamation, so violent was the uproar in the town, that the
      King, who had hitherto lodged in a private hotel, thought it prudent to
      leave, and go to pass the night in the Episcopal Palace, which was
      surrounded by high walls. Not content with this precaution, and probably a
      little ashamed of what he had done, he left the next morning at daybreak
      with all his train, without waiting for the celebration of the festival of
      Easter for which he had undertaken the journey. Such troubles and
      disorders marked the rise and fall of all the communes. Those who are
      interested in such history of the struggles of the people for liberty of
      person and action may read further the accounts of the communes in
      Guizot's admirable History of France, from which these are extracts.
      Suffice it to say here that all the towns of Cambrai, Beauvais, Amiens,
      Soissons, Rheims and several others displayed at this period a vast deal
      of energy and perseverance in bringing their lords to recognize the most
      natural and the most necessary rights of every human creature and
      community.
    </p>
    <p>
      From this brief account some idea may be had of the ancient conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us now turn to the terrible state of affairs under which the
      unfortunate inhabitants of these quaint towns of Northern France are
      suffering. In the book of Octave Beauchamp, "Le Tour de France aux Cités
      Meurtries," is the following letter (which I translate roughly) of Leonie
      Godfroy, a nurse, known as "Schwester" God-froy:
    </p>
    <p>
      "During the night of the 28th to the 29th of August, the Mayor of Noyon
      advised the people, that as the situation had become critical because of
      the approach of the German army, all those who could do so should leave
      the town to escape the terrors of the invasion."

      "In one of my school books, I remember a picture which, when I first saw
      it, filled me with horror. It represented the Exodus of the Gauls at the
      approach of the Huns, and was drawn, I think, by Gustav Doré,&mdash;the
      women half naked, dragged away by the savage soldiers; the terrified and
      crying children; the old men and women hurrying away, some empty-handed,
      others laden with all manner of objects which at any other time, or under
      different conditions would have seemed ridiculous, but which coupled with
      their terror, became pathetic. This picture now was enacted by my
      unfortunate fellow townspeople in their attempt to escape from the dangers
      of the bombardment and acts of the invaders. Crowds were running towards
      the railway depot, not realizing that the cars were already crowded to
      suffocation with half fainting women and terrified children. Others sat
      beside the ways, wailing and wringing their hands; here and there sat
      groups silent, staring as if they had lost their senses!
    </p>
    <p>
      "The forests outside the town were filled with hiding, terrified women,
      and here the Uhlans gathered on the morning of the 30th, after the
      invasion and occupation of Noyon. During this flight from town many women
      became mothers by the roadside, and lay there helpless until attended to
      by the German Ambulance Corps. The Germans arrived on the 30th of August.
      They entered Noyon after having fired three great shells into the city,
      which met with no response. The silence of death was over the town, save
      for the howling here and there of an abandoned dog, shut indoors.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We, the staff at the hospital, gathered about the president of our
      committee, with clasped hands, vowed solemnly that come what would, we
      should remain at our post, to do our duty to the end. With us stayed some
      courageous young women nurses, and several of the attendants.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Some hours before we had received at the hospital some dozen or so
      wounded English soldiers from the front. We were in the midst of our work
      with these, when there came the sound of violent banging on the front
      door. Two Uhlans burst in past the attendant and entered the court.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Catching sight of us ranged about the cot of a wounded soldier, these
      pushed us aside, examined the condition of the wounded men in the room and
      without saying one word to any of us, hurriedly took their departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      "From this instant our wounded were prisoners of war, and must resign
      themselves to all the circumstances of such state. The smallest resistance
      (of course there could be no resistance whatever on their part, wounded
      unto death as they were) would be visited upon us all; we would be shot in
      groups, and the hospital burned. Shortly after this a 'section'
      (so-called) entered the hospital without any formality, pistols in hand.
      The officers at once commandeered the autos in the court, and demanded our
      entire supply of gasolene.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Behind these advance soldiers, the German troops began to defile past the
      windows in plain sight. Then came weary men covered with dust and grime of
      the march, demanding food and drink. Some of these threw themselves upon
      the cots beside the lesser wounded, and seemed instantly to fall asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We were soon unable to reply satisfactorily to the questions of the
      officers. They asked us, Frenchmen, how we found the French; if the
      English were numerous; if they had burned the bridges. We answered as well
      as we could, and as briefly as possible without giving them offense. The
      rooms being full, we placed foot tubs in the court, and attended to them.
      For the most part they impressed us filled with a great anxiety, even
      fear...." (Here follow allegations that are untranslatable&mdash;ignoble&mdash;they
      are omitted.)
    </p>
    <p>
      "We saw from the windows regiments of men in gray passing in great
      disorder, the men covered with dust and grime, and not always keeping
      step. Great army wagons passed, the drivers of which slept nodding on the
      seats. Some we saw fall as the wagons lurched. The horses seemed spent,
      and only kept going because of heavy blows and prods from bayonets.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This army of invasion resembles more an army in retreat. Imagine the
      state of affairs in this little city of Noyon, once so happy and peaceful,
      now resounding with the noise of the great guns of the Germans both day
      and night&mdash;nights of terror!
    </p>
    <p>
      "All the grocery shops are pillaged and gutted, so also the pharmacies and
      the bazaars.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Many of the houses are turned into something like shops for the barter of
      objects stolen by the soldiers in the town. In these furniture, silver,
      objects of art and linen are exchanged and packed up to be sent to
      Germany. The inhabitants are commanded to deposit with the 'Kommandantur'
      not only all firearms, but also all photographic cameras and telephone
      instruments in their possession. All pigeons in the town have been killed
      to prevent their being employed as messengers by the people. In occupying
      Noyon, the Germans have attempted to strip the place thoroughly of
      everything of value. Their hospital ambulances, called 'lazarets,' are
      used to gather in the proceeds of their thefts.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is one at the theater, and others in the most important
      establishments. Here all that is collected by the soldiers each day is
      taken. The wine cellars have been emptied, it is said, and large
      quantities shipped to Germany. It has for days now been impossible for us
      to get a bottle of wine for our patients."

      "In the great bombardment now going on of Noyon by the French endeavoring
      to drive out the enemy, the <i>faubourgs</i> have suffered greatly; that
      of d'Amiens, the boulevards and the Rue d'Oroire particularly. The gas
      works and the depot are both destroyed, as well as the military casernes.
      I have heard the officers say how much they admire the French cannon, and
      the artillery corps. They frequently repeat in our hearing the ancient
      'blague'&mdash;the Germans and the French should be friends&mdash;they
      will be sooner or later&mdash;they should unite for the good of humanity
      and for the downfall of England!&mdash;From officer to soldier this is the
      shibboleth. It does not ring true! Now and then there are visits from
      princes and dignitaries, accompanied by tremendous excitement and troops
      blazing with color, bands of music, and all intended to impress and
      encourage the dusty, dirty troops of soldiers who are continually coming
      from and going to the front, and lend a factitious animation to the town.
      Each day the German 'Etat Major' sends out the 'communiqués,' which are
      placarded all over town. The people of Noyon who remain pay little
      attention to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They do, however, study and commit to memory the rules of circulation.
      For instance, it is dangerous for one to pass twice on any given day in
      the same street; to stand talking with a friend without plausible reason,
      or to go to the railway station or walk upon a public promenade without
      permission. In the evening all are ordered to be in the house by four
      o'clock. The town is plunged in inky darkness at night, for the gas house
      and works are destroyed. Those who must have light use candles, but the
      price of these has risen beyond all belief. All lights at night are
      carefully hidden by blinds and heavy curtains, for at the least ray of
      light seen by the German patrol, suspicion is cast upon the inmates, and a
      'crime' of this sort invariably brings arrest and a night in confinement
      under guard at the 'post' or even the risk of being sent to Germany. I
      have seen young and old, a priest and a sacristan thus sent away.
    </p>

      "Often even a gesture misunderstood by a patrol results in the banishment
      of the offender over the border into Germany.

      "The Mayor of Noyon has carried on the difficult tasks entrusted to him
      with great skill and remarkable courage. Many times his administrations
      have placed him in grave danger, but so far he has not suffered for his
      demands for justice towards his unfortunate fellow townsmen.

      "Every Sunday mass is celebrated in the untouched part of the Cathedral. A
      Protestant service also is given following it. The troops attend in two
      detachments, and the sight of these two bodies at once in the Cathedral is
      sufficiently curious, and certainly most unusual.

      "In the afternoon the officers arrange a sort of concert, at which artists
      who are unlucky enough to be here are expected to perform. These are
      usually melancholy affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When the town was first occupied by the Germans, in September, 1914, it
      was to the Cathedral that they sent their prisoners for confinement. The
      inhabitants were ordered to bring provisions for them, but were not
      allowed access to them. It was necessary to intrust the food they brought
      to the sentinels, and no one knows whether the food reached the poor
      prisoners or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As for the Cathedral, I can say truly that the two great towers were
      constantly used by the German soldiers as posts of observation. Our
      glorious dead have been laid at rest at the foot of an immense cross
      erected outside the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Germans have prepared for their dead a large 'fosse' in the middle of
      a field. An armed picket guard assists at the interments of both French
      and Germans, at which military honors are scrupulously observed and given.
      These ceremonies, often under the heavy fire of the great guns of the
      French, have made an impression upon me that I shall never forget.

    <p>
      "Hearing my name I turned and prepared to follow the two men, but these
      rough men, deeming my movements not quick enough, seized me by the arms
      and pushed me towards the stairs leading to my chamber. In the hallway I
      perceived my companions, each grasped by a 'gendarme.' An officer and five
      men pushed me with them into my chamber and locked the door; then these
      men, with a brutality impossible here to describe, ransacked my bed,
      ripped open the mattress and pillows, after which they turned the contents
      of my valise out on the floor, threw my clothing about; even breaking off
      the legs of my '<i>table de nuit</i>' to see if I had not letters or
      papers hidden therein. I kept my temper, remaining quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Seeing me so calm seemed to render them furious at finding nothing to
      incriminate me. My trunk in a corner of the room attracted their
      attention, and they roughly ordered me to open it. I made them understand
      that there was no key to it. One of them wrenched off the lid with his
      saber, to discover that the trunk was empty. They then questioned me
      minutely, after eyeing suspiciously several German newspapers lying on the
      table.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'You speak German, and you refuse to admit it; but do not mistake&mdash;you
      and the others&mdash;we know you to be Belgians, and if you can get to
      Paris, it is not for the purpose of caring for the wounded...'
    </p>
    <p>
      "This seemed so foolish to me that I refused to answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For at least ten minutes they bent over my poor papers, my little
      souvenirs, and a piece of paper money which they examined minutely,
      thinking to find state secrets, I suppose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Afterwards, when they returned my money, they kept five or six letters
      which I had preserved and kept by me as dear relics, precious letters from
      my mother and sisters... Their gross impoliteness made no outward
      impression upon me, but the instant their attention was attracted from me,
      and they turned their heads in another direction, I threw adroitly in a
      corner of my valise, which remained open beside me, a small packet which I
      carried in the waist of my dress. In this I had written a sort of diary of
      my experiences since the beginning of the war, together with accounts
      given me by wounded Frenchmen of their personal impressions of the combats
      in which they had been wounded; a few sketches and such matters, all
      innocent of any military value, but which, if found upon me, would have
      but one quick result... I pushed the valise farther under the table with a
      stealthy movement of my foot. The men then left the room, shutting the
      door behind them. Almost instantly two horrible 'Schwestern' entered
      without knocking, and proceeded to undress me, examining even the lining
      of my clothes for concealed papers&mdash;Of course they found none. My
      companions suffered the same indignities at the hands of these horrible
      creatures, who seemed to us more brutes than women. When they had gone,
      and I was sure that no one observed, I again concealed the packet of
      papers in the waist of my dress as before."
    </p>
    <p>
      Of her further adventures I can give no more here. She was taken away from
      Noyon shortly after the experience just related and sent to a detention
      camp of Holzminden in Germany with her companion nurses. Her experiences
      there were remarkable, and after serving with faithfulness until the
      following April, she was sent to Rastadt, the fortress, from which she
      obtained permission to leave, and return to Noyon by way of Switzerland.
      She finishes by writing: "Now, after more than a year has passed, I am
      once more in our dear little cottage, among those whom I had thought and
      feared never to see again. Alas&mdash;the war continues. Certainly I
      dreamed that war was very different from what I found it to be, and if my
      health returns to me, as I hope, I shall resume my work. I have seen the
      soldiers in the midst of battle at the front; I have attended them in the
      ambulances with undreamed of wounds; I have listened to and received their
      agonized confidences, and attended them to the end. They are all heroes to
      me... I have known them in captivity, famished for food, insulted,
      brutalized by their captors. Our brave boys!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Their courage, the grandeur of their souls, their indifference to pain in
      the face of duty, imparts to me something of their courage which inspires
      me.

      One revolts at these terrible pictures and accounts of the ravages of war
      in this former peaceful town, now so ravaged by the German army. Its
      picturesque town hall with the emblazoned coat of arms below the turret,
      where those flocks of white pigeons paraded the coping, cooing in the
      sunshine&mdash;now a mass of blackened ruin, behind a vast hole in the
      ground in what was once the town square, marking where one of the great
      shells fell and burst; and the shattered towers of the gray old Cathedral,
      the roof of which is gone, leaving the debris filled interior open to the
      rainy gray cloudy sky. Where now are the throngs of happy, apparently
      care-free peasants who thronged the "place" before the flag-hung old Town
      Hall that morning we last saw it in September, 1910?...
    </p>
    <p>
      The Patron Saints' day&mdash;a day dear to the peasants. This festival
      which takes place but once a year, is an event in the peasant's life. On
      this day he invites his friends and his relatives to his house, each in
      turn. In such communities throughout France, where the church still
      preserves authority, the priest earnestly endeavors to protect the
      peasants from the wiles and temptations of sin&mdash;this is one of the
      few days when dancing is allowed. Thus in each section of the country or
      province the occasion is given a different name, although the
      circumstances of its celebration do not differ greatly.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the North of France the day is known under the name of "La Dricasse,"
      in the East as "La Rapport," in Savoy as the "Vogue"; in Touraine as the
      "Assemblée"; as the "Ballade" in Poitou; as the "Frairie" in Angoumois;
      and as the "Pardon" in Brittany.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day before the fête, long lines of wagons with peddlers and
      mountebanks arrived in the "place" and each took up its station upon a
      position marked out with white stones, according to whatever license has
      been allotted to the showman at the Town Hall. There was no disorder
      whatever, no dispute with the <i>Sergeant de Ville</i>, whose word is law.
      The wagons were unpacked in the light of flaring naphtha torches under the
      excited eyes of the gamins who formed a wondering, pushing ring about the
      workmen until driven away by the police.
    </p>
    <p>
      One may believe that during that night the peasants slept lightly for
      thinking of the joys of the feasting and dancing of the morrow. At dawn of
      day the chimes in the cathedral awakened them. Soon they thronged the
      streets, the men dressed in new blouses, or treasured wedding coats, the
      girls all in unaccustomed finery of stiff skirts and Sunday headdress.
    </p>
    <p>
      All go to mass on a day of this sort as a sacred duty. The old Cathedral
      was crowded to the doors with the people; sitting and standing. Late
      comers fared badly and remained at the porch. Even there, they knelt
      piously at their devotions.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it seemed to us that the whole congregation was nervously excited and
      impatient to be gone. We could not hear the words of the priest's sermon,
      but undoubtedly he counseled them to keep sober and to beware of the
      attractiveness of sin.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Amen was chanted how quickly the peasants left the old church!
      How they hastened to the square, where already flags were flying all
      about, and where the mountebanks were shouting out the attractions of
      their tented shows; where the booths displayed their attractive
      collections of brassy jewelry; and the firemen were gathered bravely in
      their brazen horsehair-plumed helmets, all ranged about the absurd
      diminutive fire pump, two feet in height and mounted on four twelve-inch
      scarlet wheels. How innocent, even pathetically ludicrous it seemed, yet
      what a charm it all had for us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything was calculated to attract and excite the desires of these
      simple people, who know nothing of the luxuries to which free born
      Americans are so accustomed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here in the open square sharp-eyed Semitic merchants from Paris unpacked
      their paniers and heavy cases of cheap clothing, gaudy ribbons and flimsy
      varnished furniture, over which the women and girls crowded and pushed
      excitedly, fingering their lean purses, containing their hard earned
      "francs," and eagerly bargaining for the usually worthless articles. The
      "barkers" called out loudly the merits of the shows, before which, on
      elevated board platforms, hard faced girls in tights and motley clad
      buffoons paraded. Tinsel and glitter never failed to attract the peasant,
      and the clashing cymbal and the loudly beaten drum gives him delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, before the old Town Hall, built three centuries ago, a modern moving
      picture tent was set up, with a large sign over it reading thus: "Cinema&mdash;Américain.
      Phonograph&mdash;Edison. Entree f. 1.50"&mdash;but the peasants did not
      yet know what this meant and they seemed dubious about it. The fortune
      teller, however, was highly successful, and his long green canvas covered
      wagon was surrounded by an eager waiting crowd of women; the men did not
      seem to care for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      An itinerant quack dentist, in a magnificently varnished open carriage
      hung with flags and diplomas from the "Crowned Heads of Europe," was
      extracting "an aching tooth," from the mouth of a frightened boy, who
      leaped away from the carriage, as the quack held up the offending tooth in
      a glittering forceps before the astonished eyes of the peasants. Spitting
      out blood, the boy, holding his jaw in his hands, and surrounded by other
      admiring "gamins," went away behind the back of a cart; following him I
      was just in time to see him display a bright new one franc piece to the
      others who were grouped about him. They all jumped away at my approach.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did your teeth ache badly?" I asked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, M'sieur, not at all, but he offered me one good silver franc for it,
      and <i>Mère de Dieu</i>, what would you?&mdash;a franc is a franc&mdash;and
      I have plenty of teeth left!"
    </p>
    <p>
      In the gorgeous carriage stood the loud mouthed "quack" flourishing the
      teeth in the silver plated forceps, and calling for "amateurs" to come
      forward and have their teeth out.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were booths filled with sweets about which the children lingered
      most longingly, and others where "fritters" were cooked in evil smelling
      grease, which were eagerly bought and consumed in large quantities by the
      young fellows and their girls.
    </p>
    <p>
      The various small inns and drinking-places were filled to suffocation the
      whole day long. From the open windows and doors came the sounds of loud
      singing, mingled with the raucous tones of barrel organs, and the jingling
      of glasses and bottles. There was much shouting and laughing on the part
      of the peasants, who on ordinary occasions are serious enough, if not
      morose. That night the festival was in full swing. The two large
      "merry-go-rounds" with their gaudily painted wooden lions, tigers, and
      horses, were whirling about in blazing circles laden with excited boys and
      screaming girls, to the groaning strains of large barrel organs, filling
      the air with noise. These merry-go-rounds were ornamented thickly with
      squares and diamonds of mirror glass, and these made a magnificent
      whirling show in the square. There was, too, the town orchestra vainly
      endeavoring to play the popular music, and finally there were some
      sputtering fireworks, followed by a speech by the Mayor, and a "retraite
      aux Flambeaux," consisting of a dozen firemen with oil lamps, which,
      preceded by a drum corps, made the round of the adjacent streets.
    </p>
    <p>
      After seeing this we returned to our little Hôtel du Nord, for it was near
      to midnight, but all night long the festivities went on in the square, and
      in the small dancing halls.
    </p>
    <p>
      We thought it all most quaint, even somewhat pathetic then.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the act of the aggressor which has swept away this pretty little town,
      leaving nothing but blackened, fire-eaten walls, and driving a simple
      innocent people into exile is nothing short of a crime against humanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the ruin wrought in the neighborhood of Noyon and Lassigny by the
      Teutons before they abandoned this part of their line a correspondent (<i>Le
      Matin</i>, Paris) states that it is difficult to speak without entering
      into details of the most sordid character.
    </p>
    <p>
      What were once charming streets in Lassigny are now covered with masses of
      rubbish discarded by the Germans when they plundered the city. The
      beautiful old fifteenth century church, which was the Mecca for thousands
      of sightseers in times before the war, has been reduced to a heap of
      stones. Along the road from Lassigny to Noyon the spectacle of ruin is the
      same. Suzoy and many small villages were too far from the French lines to
      be damaged by the heavy artillery fire, but they bear, nevertheless, many
      traces of the barbarian rage. All furniture that could not be carried off
      by the Germans was battered and broken to prevent its use even for
      firewood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Much of it was piled in heaps along the road and burned to ashes. In some
      parts of the road the French found carts loaded with household furniture
      which the Germans in their haste were unable to move or burn. Farm
      implements, curtains, carpets and most of the household goods of the
      villages were smashed and in some cases covered with offal.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Noyon the houses have suffered comparatively little damage. The most
      noticeable wreckage was done in the vicinity of the bridges which had been
      blown up to prevent and delay pursuit. At some places the Germans exploded
      bombs and mines in the middle of the roadway, causing immense holes and
      ridges. The Cathedral is ruined; likewise the notable and remarkable old
      Town Hall, but the quaint old fountain in the Square has by some good
      fortune escaped damage. In March, 1917, on their departure from Noyon, the
      Germans delegated a staff of officers to visit the different banks in the
      town.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several prominent citizens were brought along to accelerate the work of
      pillage, and the officers compelled the opening of all safes. Even the
      minute objects whose chief value lay in sentimental attachment were taken
      by the Germans.
    </p>
    <p>
      Securities, jewelry and silver in the banks, amounting to $500,000
      approximately, were taken before the town was evacuated.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Poiret, mayor of the village of Pimpres, who was separated from his
      family two years ago, and compelled to remain at Noyon, says of his
      treatment by the Germans: "The humiliations we had to put up with are
      indescribable. During the last few weeks our physical discomforts became
      unbearable. There was neither meat, nor coal, nor vegetables, nor fat. In
      addition the Germans cut all the mains, so that we had no gas. They were
      constantly requisitioning what little we had. They took even the bells
      from the ruins of the Cathedral, and the old Town Hall, and last week the
      great organ in the church (Sainte Chapelle of the old Bishop's Palace) was
      removed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We were joyous when we heard that the Germans were preparing to leave on
      Friday night. We were told to remain indoors on penalty of being shot if
      we stirred outdoors.
    </p>
    <p>
      "During the night the Germans blew up mines in the streets and dammed up
      the river Verse so as to flood the town. The evacuation began the
      following night (Saturday) and was finished by daybreak.
    </p>
    <p>
      "On Sunday at 11 o'clock the sight of French cavalry coming up the street
      toward my house was the most 'gorgeous' spectacle I have seen for more
      than two years."
    </p>
    <p>
      During the nights of March 16 and 17, two companies of German infantry
      arrived at the village of Ham, where there was a famous château (tenth
      century) of the Counts of Vermandois and later of the family of Coucy. The
      infantry remained until the following day, pillaging systematically, under
      orders of their officers, everything in the neighborhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ancient Château of Coucy furnished them with considerable valuable
      booty, and here four officers burned and broke up all the furniture they
      could not carry away. The château was in the form of a rectangle flanked
      at each corner by a round tower, and with great square towers on the north
      and east. The round tower at the northeast angle which rose from the canal
      was the work of Louis de Luxembourg in 1490. and was called the "Tour du
      Connetable," and bore above the portal the motto of its founder, "Mon
      Myeul." Its walls were of tremendous thickness and strength. The whole
      lower story was an immense hall of hexagonal form, and it had a number of
      strange pits, called furnaces, which were to be used to blow up the castle
      in case of capture. In this château many notable personages had been
      confined; for instance, Jeanne d'Arc; Condé, the Huguenot leader; Jacques
      Cassard of Nantes; and Prince Napoleon, after his failure and capture at
      Boulogne in 1840. This great and historical château they wantonly
      destroyed; after sacking it they blew it up with cases of explosives
      placed in the walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      The officers took away from their sleeping quarters in the town all
      chairs, bed clothing and even the smallest toilet articles. Some of the
      soldiers excused their acts to the townspeople by informing them that all
      this was done "by order of the Emperor."
    </p>
    <p>
      General von Fleck, commanding officer of the army corps stationed at Ham,
      took everything in the house he occupied from the cellar to the roof,
      using a wagon to carry away the objects. "After the wagon had gone with
      the last chair in the house, the general found himself in need of one on
      which to write a letter, so an orderly was dispatched to get one at the
      Mairie."

    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE little town of
      Meaux on the banks of the Marne is only thirty miles or so from Paris, and
      was remarkable for its old mills on the bridge over the river bed, behind
      the Hôtel de Ville, as well as for the beautiful cathedral of St. Etienne.
      The beauties of the town could best be appreciated from the shady walk
      along the river side. Here were great shade trees overhanging the roadway,
      through the branches of which one got glimpses of the cream colored tower
      of the old cathedral, above the red tiled roofs of the town, all against a
      summer sky of pale blue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon reaching the town, there were the two bridges over the Marne, both of
      them covered with some old mills with high wooden walls and quaint
      buttresses; almost theatrical and unbelievable in these practical days.
    </p>
    <p>
      The town had about twelve or thirteen thousand inhabitants, and was busied
      with a trade in grain. Some rather handsome boulevards seemed entirely out
      of key with the rest of the town, but there were the remains of an ancient
      chateau of the Counts of Flanders, built during the thirteenth, or maybe
      the twelfth century, accounts differ, which seemed much more in keeping
      with the place, and a most delightful little hotel called the "<i>Trois
      Rois</i>" from which it was hard to get away, so ideal were its comforts,
      and so moderate its charges.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meaux, says history, was the refuge of the noble ladies of France in the
      Jacquerie revolts of the thirteenth century, when the horrors of the rebel
      persecutions at Beauvais commenced. Once having reached the shelter of its
      walls, they dared not leave, and remained prisoners until the terror
      ended. Here remained the Duchesses of Orléans and Normandy among others no
      less famous and prominent, so that intrepid warrior, the Captai de Buch,
      accompanied by the Earl of Foix, gathered together a force of armed men
      for their rescue.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the roads leading to the town, from Paris, from Beauvoisie, from
      Valois, were filled with bands of peasantry, all bound for the town, which
      they had heard contained great treasure. Arriving at Meaux, de Buch and
      Foix were welcomed with great joy, for the peasants had begun to pillage
      wherever they could. Then ensued a great slaughter in which the marauding
      peasants were rounded up and killed like rats by the armed warriors. "They
      flung them in great heaps into the river. In short, they killed upwards of
      seven thousand; not one would have escaped if they had chosen to pursue
      them."
    </p>
    <p>
      Meaux, too, is famous for a great siege during the wars of Henry V, when
      he camped before the town walls in 1421. Monstrelet says, "The King of
      England was indefatigable in the siege of Meaux, and having destroyed many
      parts of the walls of the market place, he summoned the garrison to
      surrender themselves to the King of France and himself, or he would storm
      the place. To this summons they replied that it was not yet time to
      surrender, on which the King ordered the place to be stormed. The assault
      continued for seven or eight hours, in the most bloody manner;
      nevertheless, the besieged made a most obstinate defense, in spite of the
      great numbers that were attacking them. Their lances had been almost all
      broken, but in their stead they made use of spits, and fought back with
      such courage that the English were driven back from the ditches, which
      encouraged them much."
    </p>
    <p>
      Eventually, however, not receiving help from the Dauphin, upon which they
      had counted, they capitulated to Henry's soldiers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the treaty which followed, they agreed: "On the 11th day May, the
      market place, and all Meaux was to be surrendered into the hands of the
      Kings of France and England."
    </p>
    <p>
      As a warning to the people against further insurrection the leader, one
      Vauras, "the bastard," who had in his career killed many English and
      Burgundians, was hanged, drawn, and quartered before the walls of the
      town.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this, King Henry, who was very proud of his victory, entered the
      town in great pomp and splendor, remaining for some days with his princes
      and attendants, and left after giving orders that the town walls should be
      rebuilt and all other damages repaired.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ancient building called the "Evêché" near the cathedral was the
      residence of Bossuet, the famous preacher, in 1681. He was nicknamed the
      "Aigle de Meaux," and renowned for his eloquence, even at a time when
      France was rich in such genius. Bossuet stood head and shoulders even
      above such contemporaries as Mas-silon and Bourdaloue, Arnauld, Fleury,
      and Fénelon. It was really he who established the privileges and liberty
      of the Gallican church.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here in the little green garden behind the gray walls of the "Evêché," he
      sat, mused, and wrote his essays upon the encroachments of Papacy, which
      destroyed the remnants of Pope Innocent's power in France.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his later years he remained in seclusion here at Meaux, leading the
      life of a simple parish priest, and here he died "full of honors and
      beloved by all," and was buried in the church in 1704. A handsome statue
      by Ruxtiel was erected in his honor on the south side of the choir.

      Here, too, was a fine kneeling statue of Philip of Castile, dated 1627.

    <p>
      But the great point of attraction for the stranger at Meaux was the bridge
      and the old timbered mills which overhung it, and the curious greeny water
      of the river Marne.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not ascertain what gave the water its green color; it did not seem
      natural, yet there were apparently no dye works near at hand&mdash;none of
      the inhabitants whom I questioned seemed able to answer my question; they
      had never noticed it, they said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The morning upon which I made my sketches of the ancient mills and the old
      bridges, there were two of them over the river, the sky suddenly darkened,
      and a heavy shower of rain fell. I took refuge in the open doorway of one
      of the old mills, and sat on the lower step of a ruinous dusty steep
      stairway leading upwards into mysterious deep shadows. Somewhere in the
      interior sounded the rhythmic beating of heavy machinery, but save for
      this, the "drumming fingers of the rain," and an occasional tinkle of a
      bell high up in the tower of the cathedral, there were no signs or sounds
      of life. Meaux is not a large town, neither is it a very lively one, but
      it is charmingly situated. Were it farther away from Paris, I doubt not
      that it might attract the tourist, for it has a most delightful public
      promenade along the river Marne which is entered immediately before the
      railway station. But up to the time of the outbreak of the great world
      war, Meaux was comparatively unknown to the foreigner tourist, and were it
      not for the old mills of which I had heard, I should not have stopped
      there. The cathedral treasury possessed copies of nine of Raphaël's
      cartoons, and included two of the three "lost" ones, described as
      "Martyrdom of St. Stephen and Conversion of St. Paul." There were also
      copies of frescoes by Guido Reni and Dominichino, an "Adoration of the
      Magi" after Champaigne and an "Annunciation" after Stella. I had made
      notes concerning these in my pocket diary and as I sat on the step in the
      old doorway of the dusty mill, I mused over the pages while the raindrops
      fell outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      All at once the door swung to slowly, and when I tried to open it, I found
      that it was fast and would not yield. There was no sort of knob visible in
      the gloom, nor was there any aperture in the door through which light
      could come. There seemed to be light somewhere above, so I mounted the
      steps, which stopped abruptly before another closed door which, however,
      was not fastened, for it yielded at once to my touch. There was a small
      window here of four panes thick with dust, through which some feeble light
      came. More steep steps led upward, and I continued to mount, judging that
      I should soon come to some sort of room where there were men at work.
    </p>
    <p>
      But at the top of these stairs was a similar door and more steps, and
      still another flight brought me into an immense empty room with an uneven
      floor, the planks of which were loose here and there and gave alarmingly
      to my weight. Overhead huge beams crossed and recrossed the dimness, and
      on these beams perched countless numbers of rooks, who uneasily regarded
      my intrusion. The windows&mdash;there were five of them&mdash;I could not
      reach from the floor, nor could I by jumping up, try as I might, reach the
      sills, so that I might see out. Backwards and forwards I passed, and then
      along the blank wall which I judged adjoined the neighboring mill, seeking
      a doorway. I could find none. Finally I found a small door, not more than
      three feet from the floor in the blank wall. This was fastened by a hasp
      and opened readily. I got down on my hands and knees in the dust which lay
      thickly, and crept through it into a second large dim room, almost the
      counterpart of that which I had just left, save that it was lighted by
      only one window and this without glass. It, too, was high up in the wall
      like the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the very middle of the uneven floor was an unguarded opening through
      which the heavy ropes of a pulley hung. I lost no time in feeling my way
      carefully down the steps at one side which were without any rail to hold
      on to. I found that there was a ladder here by which I might descend,
      which I did at once, but with some misgivings as to where it might land
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now I heard voices from below and, reassured, I put foot to the ladder. In
      a few moments I was on the floor below, but as I was about to walk away
      from the ladder in the darkness towards an opening on the farther end, I
      bethought me to put out a foot carefully to try the floor. To my horror
      there was no floor there, and retreating I lighted a match and threw it
      before me. The feeble flame was enough to show a great black chasm where I
      had thought to step a moment before, and the hair on my scalp rose in
      fright at my escape. I shouted aloud for help&mdash;I heard running
      footsteps&mdash;and right beside me a door opened letting in a flood of
      daylight and the figure of one of the millers, who regarded me with
      openmouthed astonishment, as well he might.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I had explained my predicament, he and the other men who gathered
      about were loud in their expressions of wonder at my escape from a
      terrible death, for had I but stepped a foot farther, I had fallen forty
      or fifty feet into a sluiceway from which they vowed I never could have
      escaped alive. I invited all hands over to the café, and there I gave
      offerings to Bacchus in honor of my escape which were eagerly consumed by
      the millers of Meaux.

      M. Georges Montorgueil, writing in "La Cités Meurtries, 1916," his account
      of the early days of terror in Meaux, gives a picture of the old priest
      who so devotedly and courageously shepherded his little flock of women and
      children, helpless before the invasion and destruction of the town by the
      Germans:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where, meanwhile, was the venerable priest, an old man of seventy-five
      years, the Abbé Fossin, whose age and gray hairs was no protection, to
      him, nor the eighteen unfortunates who were seized with him by the Germans
      and thrown into jail, under the most atrocious circumstances, not matched
      by any of its most ancient barbarities when the Germans were known as
      'Huns.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Abbé Fossin kept a Journal of events during the tragic hours
      preceding his arrest:
    </p>
    <p>
      "'5th of September, 1914. Saturday.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I read my breviary. An aéroplane passed above my head. The bodies of two
      pilots killed by a bomb were taken to the cemetery. A group of captured
      French soldiers are passing. "L'église en ambulance." The prisoners of
      Guerard have gone. All the electric lights in the town are out.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'6th September. Sunday.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'A bad night. Impossible to say Mass or hold funeral of the two aviators
      in the cemetery because of the falling shells. The cannonade began at nine
      o'clock and lasted until five o'clock without interruption. We are under a
      very rain of fire! The batteries of the Germans, placed behind the
      presbytery, have been located by the English. I believe my last hour has
      arrived. The din is frightful! I have thanked God that I am protected.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'7th September. Monday.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'The battle has recommenced. Still impossible to say the Holy Mass. I
      paid a visit to the Germans in the Church. These are the most terribly
      wounded. They gave me their hands. They are badly off. I cannot give them
      bread; all I had, all the fruits of my garden have disappeared! I have
      nothing left!&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      "The diary ends here. Here was a holy man of venerable years of known
      truth and great charity, visiting his enemies to give them what he had,
      his prayers. He had nothing else to give. He was fatigued for lack of
      sleep. He was hungry, but he had nothing to eat. All he had in his meager
      house and small garden had been either taken away or destroyed. Witness
      now his recompense: less than an hour after he had written those last
      notes in his diary, the Germans had seized and dragged him before a
      wrathful German officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He was charged with having climbed the tower of the cathedral to signal
      to the British lines. He who so suffered from rheumatism that he could
      hardly walk from his doorway to the church, a few paces away, by the aid
      of a cane. He was insulted by the officer, the soldiers who held him up
      before his questioner spat in his face. At length his shoes and clothes
      were stripped from him, and with great brutality he was thrown into a
      cellar, where he spent the night, with some potato bags to cover him. In
      the morning the door above was flung open, and a number of captives were
      thrown down the steep steps of the cellar way. These were Milliardet,
      Jourdin, Vapaille, Therré, Croix, Eugene Leriche, Lacour, Jules Denis,
      Berthelemy Denis, Merillon, Combes, Mesnil, Liévin, Faure and his son,
      aged fifteen, who was baker's boy in the village of Vareddes, and known
      under the nickname of 'Marmiton.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "To this group the Germans added later in the day Paul Lebel and Vincent
      Denis, arrested because the latter called out to a German soldier, 'Eh,
      well, old man, you are not yet at Paris!'
    </p>
    <p>
      "On Saturday, without feeding them or allowing any one to visit them, all
      these unfortunates were divided into several groups, and surrounded by
      soldiers, hustled along the road to Lizy-sur-Ourcy, where they were
      halted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They numbered now fifteen in all, not counting the old priest, the Abbé
      Fossin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Père Leriche, who was himself seventy-four years old, relates that the
      Abbé, who lay prostrate on the ground beside him, said to him in a low
      voice, 'I believe that they are going to shoot me&mdash;take my watch and
      breviary, and try and get them to my family.' When the march was resumed
      the Abbé could not walk fast enough to suit the soldiers. He was pushed
      and struck by them, his soutane was torn to ribbons. Finally they threw
      him into a wagon which they seized on the road. In this he lay groaning.
      He died a short time later, and was left beside the road. The heat was
      atrocious; thus they marched, the younger ones sustaining the elders,
      through the long hours to the rear, without water or food, insulted and
      beaten constantly by their captors.
    </p>
    <p>
      "At Coulomb, Père Jourdain fell in the road, unable to continue the march.
      He was immediately dispatched by a revolver shot.
    </p>
    <p>
      "At Chézy-en-Orxois, another old man, Milliardet, eighty years old, was
      similarly disposed of. Any complaint was the signal of death. Both Terry
      and Croix were shot for whistling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Old Eugene Menie, who halted on the edge of a deep ditch, was struck by
      the butt of a gun in the hands of one of the soldiers, and his neck broken&mdash;they
      threw him into the ditch and went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Père Liévin, aged sixty-one, who had heart disease, could not keep step
      with the others; he was purple in the face, and his eyes stuck out so
      comically that it amused the soldiers, who finally shot him and left his
      body at the cemetery gate in Chauny."
    </p>
    <p>
      These are only haphazard extracts from the records of that terrible month
      of September, 1914, when unfortunate Meaux was the very center of affairs.
      Elsewhere we read of the aspects of the streets after each successive
      bombardment, the telegraph hanging in festoons on the footways, the trunks
      of huge trees felled by cannon barring the way; the carcasses of animals
      lying about amid strange débris, such as heavy leather shoes, broken guns,
      sticks and barrels, empty tin cans, torn and ragged clothing clotted with
      blood, strange piles of still smoking ashes containing small bones, and
      over all the odor of burning petroleum.
    </p>
    <p>
      The houses with wide open doors and sashless window frames; gardens
      uprooted and despoiled; walls thrown down, and strewn about an immense
      quantity of broken glass bottles. These were the streets of Meaux, which I
      had explored on that peaceful morning in August, 1910, and made the
      sketches of the old bridge with its clustered mills, the fire blackened
      beams now hanging in grotesque ruins over the water of the little green
      river.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bombardment began on Monday, the 7th of September, 1914. The first of
      the German shells fell upon the town at eleven in the morning, in the
      direction of the fauburg St.-Nicholas, then in the fauburg St.-Faron.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bombardment followed the line of the railway. In the cemetery the
      ancient tombs were scattered in all directions; ten shells destroyed the
      hospital. The Grand Seminary fell next. Of the one hundred and twenty
      shells which on this Monday fell in the town, the first five did the
      greatest damage. Whole lines of houses were thrown down and set on fire.
      This lasted until six in the afternoon. The next day shells began to fall
      again in the early morning. The cathedral was encircled by shells, which
      did great damage, but by a special Providence with the exception of an
      enormous hole in the roof, and the destruction of the venerable cloisters,
      the ancient cathedral escaped the fate of its neighbors.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the chronology: Wednesday, September 2, the exodus; Thursday, the
      town lay deserted and helpless; Friday, the organization of all the
      available defensive forces; Saturday and Sunday, the battle; Monday, the
      bombardment; Tuesday, the enemy driven off, and the town saved.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">F</span>ROM the railway
      station one could see the towers of the cathedral and the old church of
      St. Pierre, above the heavy trees of a short avenue which led to that part
      of the town, where formerly stood the old ramparts&mdash;and to the Porte
      Royale.
    </p>
    <p>
      The best and most picturesque part of the town, of interest to the
      antiquary, was the western end, and here were tortuous and delightful
      crooked narrow streets, quaint little gabled houses, old mossy walls
      surrounding luxuriant gardens, and some remains of the remarkable chateaux
      of a bygone period.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ancient stronghold in past centuries, it had become a little old sleepy
      town given over to churches and the priesthood. Of the ancient Gallo-Roman
      fortifications there were still to be seen, up to the outbreak of the war
      in 1914, sixteen of the Roman towers in a fair state of preservation. A
      small river, the Nonette, passes through it, winding most exquisitely.
      Situated some thirty-five miles from Paris, and on the edge of the
      Champagne district, its character could be best appraised from the
      charming public promenade along the river's bank, lined with fine trees
      and offering vistas of great picturesqueness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old cathedral dates back to the early days of the thirteenth century;
      its lace-like gray tower, covered with exquisite Gothic ornamentation, was
      a source of delight to artists and antiquarians. Usually covered with
      scaffolding, the tower was in a constant state of repair, but the spidery
      scaffolding seemed not at all to detract from the charm of its lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the architects in charge explained that the vaulting and the first
      stage of the choir, the "triform ambulatory" had been removed because of
      cracks developing in the masonry, but this alteration did not seem to have
      resulted in any loss to the interior artistically. Indeed, as it stood in
      1910, the choir elevation was a most exquisite example of thirteenth
      century construction and design.

    <p>
      Lying in the midst of the great forest lands of Chantilly and Hallette,
      Senlis, until the dissolution of the Carlo-vingian Empire, was the place
      of royal residence, and even thereafter, to the time of Henry of Navarre,
      the kings of France preferred it to all others. The Castle was built upon
      the site of the Roman Prætorium, the ruins of which were pointed out to
      tourists. The ancient Roman ramparts which still in part surrounded the
      town were also shown, and the walls were said to be thirteen feet thick.
      "They enclosed an area, oval in form, one thousand and twenty feet long
      from east to west and seven hundred and ninety-four feet wide from north
      to south. At each of the angles formed by the broken lines of which the
      circuit of two thousand seven hundred and fifty-six feet is composed,
      stands or stood a tower; numbering twenty-eight and now only sixteen, they
      are semicircular in plan, and up to the height of the wall are unpierced.
      The Roman city had only two gates; the present number is five."
    </p>
    <p>
      The old cathedral was both curious and fascinating, as well as of great
      beauty. Begun in 1154 on really enormous lines, its original plan was
      never carried out for want of funds. Century after century it had been
      rebuilt, altered, extended and replanned, until it had become, as an
      American architect of renown styled it, "an epitome of French architecture
      from the middle of the twelfth to the middle of the fifteenth century."
    </p>
    <p>
      Its companion unfinished, the great southwest tower is of the thirteenth
      century, and is said to be "unsurpassed by no other spire in France for
      subtlety of composition and perfection of detail."
    </p>
    <p>
      One of its beautiful "crocketed" pinnacles was shot away in the
      bombardment by the Germans in 1915, and the loss left the world poor
      indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is certainly a strange sensation for us to watch from a distance the
      continuous destruction of the great works of art of the world, powerless
      to prevent it. For us all this loss is personal, poignant, unexampled; a
      horror that nothing can palliate nor time soften.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ancient Renaissance tower of St. Pierre had been used as a public
      market, and also as a cavalry barrack because of its ruinous state. In
      form it was most curious, being very short and too wide for proportion.
      While the prevailing style was flamboyant, it contained a certain amount
      of early Gothic work of considerable interest and value. I regret that I
      did not make a sketch of it when I was there, for the scene at early
      morning with the crowds of market people, and the vegetable stalls all
      about, and rising above them the bare gray walls of the nave and the
      choir, formed a picture of much quaintness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The glory of the old cathedral of "Notre Dame" was the beautiful spire
      upon the southwest tower. Of infinite grace and lightness with its
      detached pillars, it rose from an octagonal base which supported a sort of
      canopy in pyramidal form, the whole adorned with a wealth of delicate
      carving and tracery, and pierced by high dormer lancet shaped windows,
      about which flew clouds of ravens or starlings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great door in the west front reminded one of that at Chartres, and was
      adorned with figures of Our Lord and the Virgin, some of the figures of
      the angels being of remarkable character and grace. Inside in the
      ambulatory, behind the altar, are some of the twelfth century Romanesque
      capitals, and elsewhere are found other evidences of Roman influence.
    </p>
    <p>
      All accounts agree that this beautiful edifice has now been entirely
      destroyed by the invader (1917).
    </p>
    <p>
      Former wars have swept the little town from time to time in the past, but
      the cathedral remained practically untouched until the present day.
      Whatever the former causes, or however violent the onslaught of the
      opposing forces, these priceless records of art were spared by common
      consent, save perhaps when the Revolution swept over the cloisters, and
      even then the havoc wrought was reparable, but now comes one calling
      himself the anointed representative of God, and annihilates an innocent
      people and destroys the treasures of a land which he cannot conquer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just what remains at this time of Senlis cannot be ascertained, but all
      accounts agree that the huge gray Romanesque tower can no longer be seen
      upon the horizon, and that the bombardment of the ruins continues. Baron
      André de Maricourt has written a most complete monograph of Senlis.
      (Senlis. Baron André de Maricourt, ancien élève de l'école des Chartes.
      "Les Cités Meurtries." Paris. Librarie de l'Eclair.)
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hidden away among the heavy trees which surround it upon all sides, lies
      the little town of Senlis, almost a suburb of Paris." According to the old
      proverb, "To live happily is to remain hidden." So Senlis remained
      comparatively forgotten. The very names of its streets were strange to
      modern ears and evoked smiles from the stranger, and its old houses,
      dating from the days of "la reine Berthe," enchanted the antiquary.

      This little town of seven thousand inhabitants was indeed one of the
      capitals of ancient France during the times of the Capets, and in the
      royal château which sheltered the chiefs of the Merovingians, and
      royalties down to the days of Henry IV, were written many pages of the
      history of France. One recalls the days of Charles le Chauve, of d'Hugues
      Capet and St. Louis, the quarrel of the Armagnaces and the Bourguignons,
      recalled by the strange picture by Melingue, "Les Otages de Senlis," which
      was in the Hôtel de Ville up to the time of the bombardment by the
      Germans. Also may be recalled the passage of Jeanne d'Arc through the
      town, and then the wars of the "Ligue,"&mdash;all proving the importance
      of Senlis of the past.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the eighteenth century, Louis XV, in order to render the town more
      accessible, constructed a fine roadway from Paris to the royal residence,
      and Senlis emerged from its quietude, amazed at the lines of gilded
      equipages and the prancing horses urged on the gallop by gorgeously
      dressed lackeys which daily thronged the way.

      This roadway, called formerly the "Rue Neuve de Paris," was the principal
      artery of the little old city, under the twenty-year-old name of "Rue de
      la République."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sung by poets, such as Gérard de Nerval, and Maurice Barrés, M. André
      Haileys described Senlis as "tortueuse, taciturne et charmante," and dwelt
      lovingly upon its "mossy terraces," its ancient walls bathed in sunlight,
      and its grand old tower whose perfect bells sounded over the golden green
      fields.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the early summer days of 1914, the Society of Amateurs held their
      celebration at Senlis, says Baron de Maricourt, "a few months ago, months
      which seem years now. The ceremony was to celebrate the Victory of
      Bouvignes. In the St. Rieul Hall, Madame la duchesse de Vendôme sat beside
      M. Odent, the mayor of the town, who spoke feelingly of ancient France,
      and of Flanders....
    </p>
    <p>
      "One month later the Hall was occupied by cavalry; our own cavalry of
      France.... On the horizon lay the German army....
    </p>
    <p>
      "Three weeks later M. Odent, the mayor, was killed in the bombardment; the
      Hall of Saint-Rieul was a hospital; the brother of the princess had become
      'Albert le Brave,' the plain of Bouvignes was bathed in blood; Senlis was
      burning; the inhabitants had fled."
    </p>
    <p>
      It would appear that Senlis was burned and sacked to inspire Paris with
      terror, and as an example of the fate that awaited her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nearly all the inhabitants fled when the news came that the Germans had
      crossed the border. A few of the citizens resolved to remain to support
      the mayor and magistrates in keeping the peace, to patrol the town to
      prevent looting, and to watch for fires. Some pieces of heavy artillery
      had been arranged before the Hôtel de Ville and under the towers of the
      Cathedral, but there was neither ammunition for these nor soldiers in the
      town to use them. The town was silent, the factories empty, the streets
      almost deserted. In the town hall, the few faithful ones remained on watch
      day and night grouped about the mayor. In some of the rooms were refugees
      from neighboring towns, old men and women with young children who had
      nowhere else to go. In the hospitals the nuns and nurses cared for the
      wounded who had been brought to the town in large numbers. There were no
      soldiers hereabouts. This is the truth (affirms the Baron de Maricourt).
      The Germans understood and saw a different picture, so they say. They
      heard the movement of vast bodies of armed men; they saw the "franc
      tireurs" in the trees firing upon them, they saw cannon protruding from
      the windows of the towers of the old cathedral.... So the knell of Louvain
      sounded for Senlis.... So wrote the Baron de Maricourt of Senlis, who
      remained in the town during the occupation by the Germans, who suffered at
      their hands all the indignities they could devise; who remained calm and
      heroic through all the terrors of the bombardment and destruction of his
      beloved town.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The first German body of troops which entered the town carried with them
      a corps of incendiaries in regular formation upon bicycles, armed with
      tubes of metal containing, as was afterwards ascertained, picric acid, and
      others a kind of wick of cotton charged with gasoline or petroleum. Some
      of the men carried hand grenades strung around their waists or over their
      shoulders, and these they threw into open windows and doorways of
      designated houses. By midnight the sky was illuminated by fires in every
      quarter of the town."
    </p>
    <p>
      It commenced in the faubourg St.-Martin. It is said that the soldiers
      warned the occupants of houses designated to leave before they set fire to
      them. "Let us be just to the German soldiers," says M. de Maricourt. "In
      the evening of the day of occupation, the Archdeacon was brought to the
      Hôtel du Grand-Cerf, by the concierge Boullay. He was paraded before the
      officers, but was not mistreated, except that he was compelled to stand,
      and no one addressed him. Finally he was ordered to return to his
      quarters, but hardly had he arrived there, before another order came for
      him to return at once to the Grand-Cerf. Already towards the south end of
      the town the houses were in flames, and he saw the soldiers carrying
      lighted torches. He was brought before an officer who spoke French and
      whose manner was not discourteous:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Monsieur,' said he, 'attend to me,'&mdash;and he read from a paper
      charges that the priest had allowed citizens to fire upon the entering
      German troops.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'It is not true,' replied the Archdeacon, 'I was alone in the church, and
      the keys were in my pocket.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "The officer read upon the face of the priest the evident sincerity of his
      words.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Poor priest! Poor town!' he said pityingly, 'I believe you, but I must
      obey orders.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'How so?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Because I am ordered to treat Senlis as was Louvain; by to-morrow there
      will remain not one stone upon another.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "M. Douvlent pleaded eloquently for his parishioners, whose innocence he
      vouched for. The officer seemed impressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'You are a Catholic priest, but alas, war is cruel, and orders are not to
      be ignored. This town merits chastisement.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Take me before the General,' urged the priest, 'I am your prisoner, and
      I have the right to plead the cause of my innocent parishioners.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'No, sir,' retorted the officer frowningly, 'nothing of the sort; do you
      not realize that you are in great danger?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Danger?' ejaculated the priest, 'I fear no danger, I have made my
      sacrifice; I have faced it all this morning.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Very well,' said the officer, somewhat more gently, 'but I think it will
      be best for you to return to your house. If necessary I will call you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "A short time after this conversation, I saw the priest, with the few who
      remained of his household, standing in the Square. I saw them again at
      about one in the morning; they were still standing in the Square beneath
      the lamp which shone upon their anxious faces. A dozen or so German
      soldiers stood about. Two sentries paced up and down, one at each
      crossing. No one returned to their houses. The curtain had risen upon the
      drama of Senlis....
    </p>
    <p>
      "At the end of this day, Thursday, M. Odent (the mayor of Senlis), left
      the Hôtel de Grand-Cerf accompanied by an officer, and entering a covered
      automobile was driven rapidly away, followed by five cavalrymen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They stopped at a place called 'le Poteari,' situated between Senlis and
      Chamont; there they found six captives whom the Germans had taken at
      hazard on the route.
    </p>
    <p>
      "One of these, named Delacroix, had been arrested in company with two
      workmen named Quentin and Reck, the latter a mason by trade, at the corner
      of the Rue de Bordeaux and la République, at the moment when the firing
      was the hottest in that quarter. Reck had been hit in the jaw and in the
      arm. The German soldiers entering the town found him bleeding in the road
      and with the singular, the unexplainable attitude of the German, at one
      moment cruel to the last degree, at the next of lamblike gentleness, these
      soldiers conducted the wounded man Reck to the 'prefecture,' <i>where his
      wounds were tenderly dressed by a German Major!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quentin and Delacroix were taken at Chamont with revolvers in their
      hands, together with a stranger who was visiting the house of his sister,
      and two others, Benoit Decrens, a domestic servant, and Boullet, a
      laborer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Up to eleven o'clock in the evening these unhappy captives were marched
      up and down the various streets and alleys of the village by their
      captors, until at length near the Bon Secours woods in a secluded spot, an
      officer ordered the mayor and the six captives to lie down on the grass.
      When this was done, he ordered the mayor, M. Odent, to rise and advance
      three paces.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The soldiers presented arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'You are the Mayor Odent?' called out the officer brusquely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Yes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'You have fired on our men?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'No.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'You have fired on our men,' insisted the ferocious voice, 'you are to be
      shot!'
    </p>
    <p>
      "M. Odent handed his papers to Benoit and shook hands with his companions.
      He then clasped his hands in prayer, after which he stood with eyes calmly
      fixed upon the officer. The officer raised his hands, motioning to the
      soldiers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They shot the mayor with their revolvers....
    </p>
    <p>
      "Afterwards, the officer made a little speech to the terrified men.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'War is as sad for us as it is for you. It is France and your Poincaré
      that you must blame&mdash;they would have it. We Germans do not make war
      upon civilians, but those who fire upon us will be promptly shot.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "These men were then used as guides by the officers, during their
      occupancy of the town. When no longer of use, <i>they disappeared.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      "There were others, too; I do not know how many. There was little Gabanel,
      the son of the butcher, a merry little chap, known throughout the
      neighborhood, he disappeared with his father's old white horse and the
      red, two-wheeled wagon. He was never heard of again... and there was the
      baker's boy Jaudin, whose mutilated body was found in a field at
      Villers-St. Frambourg.... There was the hunchback Cottreau, aged
      seventeen, a harmless cripple who was found hanging in the attic of an
      inn....
    </p>
    <p>
      "Arthur Rigault, the stone cutter, Elisée Pommier, aged 67 years....
    </p>

      "Jean Barbier, wagon driver....
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pierre Dewart, chauffeur.

    <h2>
      THE CHATEAU OF GÈRBÉVILLER
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE château and the
      Chapel Palatine of Gèrbéviller were unique in many respects. Dating from
      the thirteenth century, the chateau served as appanage to the Cadets of
      Lorraine, to whom they were given by Charles the Bold, and transmitted in
      1486 to Huet du Châtelet, whose illustrious family founded the <i>Maison
      des Cannes</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1641 it came into the hands of Charles-Emmanuel de la Tornielle,
      step-brother of Christian du Châtelet of the powerful Tornielle family,
      thence it descended successively to the Lombartyes, in whose possession it
      remained until it was seized and sold by the state in the troublous times
      of 1796.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chapel was restored, almost reconstructed and consecrated on the
      nineteenth of July, 1865, by Monsignor Lavigerie with great splendor and
      pomp in the presence of the Lombartye family and a score of dignitaries of
      the state.
    </p>
    <p>
      The château itself, constructed in the eighteenth century, was possessed
      of what the French call "grand air," and was certainly imposing in size
      from a distance, shining among the dark green of the heavy foliage which
      surrounded it. Its façade on the road was somewhat marred by the
      narrowness of the approach. But the façade on the parkway, through which a
      small brook called the "Montagne" meandered most delightfully, was most
      impressive. The sketch which I made of it will serve to show the character
      of the great house better than many pages of written description.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reputation enjoyed by this great typical château of France was not by
      any means confined to the country. It was known throughout Europe, and for
      this reason, I suppose, was a shining mark for the Teutons.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the side of the château was the grand entrance, used only upon state
      occasions. This entrance was flanked by two immense "vasques" or vases of
      dark gray marble, a little too monumental, perhaps architects might think,
      but taken together with the "grand air" of the château entirely in
      keeping, to my mind. These it is claimed still stand unharmed amid the
      ruins all about.

    <p>
      The Chapel Palatine architecturally, perhaps, does not merit extended
      eulogy. Its towers are shot away, and some blackened calcined walls are
      all that remain. But the treasures which it contained, now either
      destroyed or carried off to Berlin, who shall say if they can ever be
      replaced? I am told that the family of Lombartye, and notably its last
      representative, who restored it in 1865, was long a resident of Rome, and
      being very wealthy had collected a vast store of most valuable objects of
      art of all kinds, including statuary and paintings, and these he had
      installed not only in the château, but had so enriched the chapel that it
      was a veritable storehouse of precious objects&mdash;even more than a
      museum, because most of them related to the history of the ancient
      families who had occupied Gèrbéviller.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here then in this small chapel was a collection of marvels of decorative
      art, tapestries of Arras, examples of the jeweler's craft, illuminations
      upon vellum, a hundred or more priceless volumes, and notably a collection
      of funerary urns, containing the ashes of most illustrious personages,
      including some of the Saints. Among the treasures in this small chapel was
      a series of the tapestries of Gobelin, another of Beauvais, and a third
      complete pictorial set made in Antwerp after the cartoons of Nicolas
      Memling. These last, just before the destruction of Gèrbéviller, were
      presented to the Cathedral of Nancy. The others are among the ashes of the
      ruins.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Master altar of the chapel was covered by a magnificent "ciborium,"
      raised upon three columns of black marble, ornamented by "tears" of silver
      of twelfth century workmanship. The great candelabra, called "Flambeaux,"
      were of Flemish work, and had twenty-four lusters; these were destroyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were splendid tombs on all sides; one was a reproduction of that of
      Henry I, Count of Champagne, and of St. Etienne of Troyes; the tomb of
      Lombartye, of de la Vieufville, of Rochechourt-la-Rochefoucauld, of du
      Caylar, of Vieuville, of Gouy d'Arsy, and that of Père Jandel the
      Dominican. All these are mutilated and broken. Of the funeral urns, one
      contained the ashes of St. Auguste, the martyr; another of what is called
      "cipollin," the ashes of Ste Victoire; a red marble one those of St.
      Vital; a "chasse" held a portion of the petrified bones of Candide,
      presented by the Bishop of Nancy. Another one contained the bones of St.
      Felix Romain.
    </p>
    <p>
      A great tall "ciborium" contained the "relique" of Tarcisius, the young
      martyr of the Eucharist. These, contained in a wonderful chest covered
      with vermilion enamel, bore an epitaph composed by Pope Damase, and were
      brought from Rome by the Dominicans. Overjoyed in the possession of such a
      treasure, the Marquis of Lombartye, sought an artist of renown who could
      make a fitting monument to contain it. His choice fell upon Fal-guière the
      sculptor. He it was who fashioned the exquisite statue in the Luxembourg.
      But it is not generally known that this is a replica of the original which
      was in the Chapel of Gèrbéviller, and which is now entirely destroyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I understand that in searching the ruins, certain fragments of precious
      objects have been found and removed to Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Pigot in his report claims that the head of Fal-guière's statue of St.
      Tarcisius was found among the ashes, and, placed in a strong oaken box,
      has been given into the hands of M. le Sous-Préfet of Lunéville.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the remarkable paintings which the chapel contained are of course
      entirely consumed in the fire caused by the bombs and shells which fell
      upon the chapel for days at a time. There was the painting by Lippo Lippi;
      a portrait of Prosper Lambartini (Pope Benoit XIV); a triptych by Fra
      Angelico; one by Sandro Botticelli; The Virgin, the infant and two angels;
      a copy of the "<i>Femme Adultéré</i>" by Titian; a Benozzo Gozzoli; a
      canvas by a pupil of Ferrare, and various others. There was a splendid
      statue of the Virgin in terra cotta of the sixteenth century; a life size
      St. Joseph by Lizier-Richie; and two statues of Christ and John the
      Baptist in bronze by Dubois. Of these the statue of Christ remains (says
      M. Pigot in his report) "unharmed."
    </p>
    <p>
      The little town of Gèrbéviller itself is entirely destroyed, and the
      wretched inhabitants are scattered to the four winds. And for what good
      was all this, one asks?
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Georges Goyan, writing in the <i>Revue des Deux Mondes</i>, of the
      heroic work performed by the nuns of France, relates a touching story of a
      Sister Julia of Gèrbéviller, who, when the village was in flames and a
      German officer was about to give the order to burn the Red Cross pavilion,
      stepped before the lieutenant and with the most superb courage defied him
      to commit the sacrilege. The officer, a Bavarian, taken aback for the
      moment, bowed his head, and the pavilion was spared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sister Gabriela of the little town of Clermont-en-Ar-gonne was no less
      courageous. She advanced to meet the army of the Crown Prince when it
      arrived, saying, "We will care for your wounded, if you will spare the
      town." She received a promise, which was not kept, however. Again, she
      sought the Colonel, and bravely said, "I see now that the word of a German
      officer is not to be relied on." Ashamed, he ordered the work of
      destruction stopped, and thus the town was spared. Twenty-five wounded
      French prisoners owed their lives to this devoted nun, who in April, 1916,
      received the decoration of the war medal. Goyan quotes verbatim from the
      report of the nun, "The Major made his congratulatory speech while I was
      completing the bandage of my poor 'poilu,' whose head rested on my lap."

      Waldeck-Rousseau, the former Premier of France, in a speech before the
      French senate in 1903 stated that "Catholicism survives in France, if not
      as a religious law, faithfully observed by everybody, at least as a social
      statute respected by the vast majority." M. Goyan declares that the French
      church is indeed a moral power to be reckoned with, "and when the
      war-tocsin had rung throughout the land, when the hour of death had been
      welcomed as an old dear friend, all misunderstandings of the past melted
      away, and now for fully twenty-eight months the church could again place
      itself at the disposal of France."
    </p>
    <p>
      With emotion and gratitude he relates the patriotic sacrifices made by the
      Protestant churches and the synagogues of France. Out of four hundred and
      ninety pastors of the Lutheran and Reformed churches, "one hundred and
      eighty are in the trenches: all students of the Paris Rabbinical Seminary
      and more than three-fifths of the officiating rabbis of the Republic left
      for the front; two of them were killed, one was missing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When after this war is over, our sister churches will write their own
      martyrology, Catholic witnesses will rise to glorify their dead. The whole
      Catholic press rendered a well deserved homage to Chief Rabbi Bloch of
      Lyons, who was mortally wounded by a German bullet while he attended a
      dying Catholic soldier, holding the cross to his livid lips."
    </p>
    <p>
      After these prefatory remarks the author traces in his inimitable style a
      picture of the life and activity of the Catholic church from the
      unforgettable July days of 1914, to date. One-third of its priesthood
      followed the call of their country. *

      The Paris diocese alone has already buried forty-five of its members. The
      Cardinal-Archbishop of Lyons had to enlist laymen to fill the gaps in his
      decimated clergy. Bishops have become again parish priests.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eleven young French monks, surprised by the German invasion in their
      monastery in the grand duchy of Luxembourg, disguised themselves, walking
      stealthily into Belgium, and from there to France, immediately joining
      their barracks. Dominicans and Jesuits vie with each other in patriotic
      devotion. The Church, cheerfully accepting the abrogation of its time
      honored immunities, with a noble gesture commanded the young priests to
      shoulder their rifles: 'Your parish,' explained the Cardinal Archbishop of
      Rheims, Monseigneur Luçon, to his priests, is henceforth your regiment,
      your trench, your hospital. Love it as you have loved your church. Perhaps
      you will be buried on the battlefield. What of it? Why should we priests
      not give our blood?' Thus, the priest is no longer isolated from the
      people; he has become an integral part of it. The Dominican sergeants and
      Jesuit lieutenants have built the bridge. And who, on the other hand,
      would have believed, a short three years ago, that a company of French
      soldiers, educated in the godless school of the Republic, should, before
      preparing for assault, receive absolution on their knees?
    </p>
    <p>
      "A parallel case to this kneeling company receiving absolution is the
      scene in the Bois d'Argonne, of March 7, 1916, when 'the successive waves
      of a regiment, marching to the attack, bowed themselves before the
      representative of God, de Chabrol, Chaplain of the division, whose hand,
      while the guns were thundering, made the sign of the redemption.'" (Quoted
      textually from an order of the day, by the commanding general.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Fifty-nine priests and seminarists of the Paris diocese received crosses
      while practically under fire. "The natural love of the soil and the love
      of the church combined, produce heroic souls of a peculiarly noble
      blending. The olden days when bishops were the supreme lords of towns and
      countries were revived, if only for a short time, at Meaux, and elsewhere,
      shortly before the battle of the Marne. On September 3, 1914, the armies
      of von Kluck were expected any moment and the civil authorities fled.
      Bishop Marbeaux took possession of the City Hall, and with a rare skill
      organized the various municipal services. Generals Joffre and Galliéni had
      stopped the triumphal onslaught of the German troops. On September 9, the
      civil authorities returned to Meaux and Mayor Mar-beaux gave in his
      resignation. Similar was the situation in Soissons and Chalons-sur-Marne;
      the cathedrals again became civic centers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But our priests (continues M. Goyan) in the midst of the brutal butchery,
      are not unmindful of the Saviour's advice to love even our enemies&mdash;above
      all, if the latter are in great stress themselves. Thus Rev. Landrieux of
      the cathedral of Rheims, while the church was burning, saved from its
      ruins at the risk of his life a group of wounded German soldiers. The
      enraged population was about to lynch them. 'You will have to kill me
      first,' said the courageous priest. Words fail to describe as they deserve
      the deeds of Bishop Lobbedeye of Arras and his clergy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The tradition of the catacombs revived; a cellar was transformed into a
      church (while the town was under bombardment) and here the Bishop read his
      mass. The priests threw off their 'soutanes' to become police and firemen,
      moving men and grave diggers. One of them, de Bonnieres, of noble birth,
      went every morning, braving the bullets which whistled about his ears,
      into the suburbs begging the soldiers for the scraps, left over from their
      meals, to distribute these pittances among the starving poor of Arras."

      "Thus, before the enemy the old union of church and state had been
      effected. The same population, the same government, which before had
      adopted the slogan, The priest's place is in the church,' requested the
      cooperation of the clergy. And the church obeyed the call. Everything was
      forgotten. 'Who cares now,' exclaimed Cardinal Savin, 'for the religious
      misunderstandings, political quarrels, and personal rivalries of the past!
      France first! United by the common danger, we learned to know and respect
      one the other, and after the war we will solve the grave problems which
      had separated us before the war. Our victory will be our main ally in this
      future work of pacification.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Forever memorable will remain that great religious manifestation at Paris
      during the week of the Battle of the Marne, in honor of St. Geneviève, the
      patron of the French capital. She and Joan of Arc became again the divine
      protectors of France.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The people of Paris fell on their knees on the famous heights of
      Montmartre, the mountains of the Saint-Martyrs of the past, a place
      historical in the annals of France. Even the skeptics thanked the church
      for its resuscitation of the religious spirit. France again remembered
      that she had once been 'the eldest daughter of the Church.'" (Georges
      Goyan.)

    <h2>
      A HEROINE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>HEN the history of
      the war is written at least three names of women will be enshrined forever
      in the annals: Sister Julie, the fearless nun of Gèrbéviller; that heroic
      woman who took the place of and acted as mayor of Soissons when von
      Kluck's legions occupied and ravaged that unfortunate little city; and
      Marcelle Semmer, a young girl of eighteen, who showed such bravery and
      extraordinary fortitude in aid of France as to win encomiums from both the
      British and French officers, who recommended that she be decorated. She
      has just received both the ribbon of the Legion of Honor, and the War
      Cross as reward.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. L. L. Klotz, Deputy from the war-ravaged department of the Somme, has
      told in glowing words the story of how at the outbreak of the war, these
      noble women, left defenseless and at the mercy of the invaders, proudly
      faced these savages and really defied them.
    </p>
    <p>
      He told of Marcelle Semmer, a young orphan girl of eighteen, living in the
      little village of Eclusier, near Frise on the river Somme, at the
      beginning of the war.
    </p>
    <p>
      This young girl who showed the most extraordinary bravery and fortitude in
      the service of France, is perhaps but one of many others whose stories may
      never be known to the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was acting as bookkeeper and clerk in a factory, producing phosphates,
      which had been founded by her father, an Alsatian refugee.
    </p>
    <p>
      The invaders, driving back the Allies at Charleroi, captured the town,
      taking many prisoners. The French fell back across a canal, near the home
      of Marcelle Sem-mer, where there was a drawbridge. The heroic girl,
      unmindful of her danger, succeeded in raising the drawbridge before the
      enemy came up, and threw the lever into, the canal. Without this lever the
      bridge could not be lowered again. The canal at this point was so deep
      that the invading army could not ford it, and seeing the fleeing figure of
      the girl, the soldiers fired volley after volley after her, without once
      hitting her.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this audacious act, Marcelle Semmer held back the advance of an entire
      German army corps until the following day, for the Germans had to await
      the arrival of their engineers before they were able to put a temporary
      bridge in place, and this they made of boats, and pontoons hastily
      constructed, thus consuming hours which were of great value in enabling
      the hard-pressed French to escape from the hordes which far outnumbered
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of the danger of detection, the young girl insisted upon
      remaining in the village during its occupation by the Germans; happily
      they did not recognize her as the girl who raised the drawbridge against
      them or she would have been shot at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      Near the factory where she worked was a shed covering a subterranean
      passage leading to the phosphate mine. She succeeded in concealing the
      entrance trap to this passage by means of some large tuns and bagging.
      During the night she managed to conceal in this passage no less than
      seventeen French soldiers who had been somehow left in the retreat from
      the towns of Mons and Charleroi. Not only did she succeed in keeping these
      men hidden, but she managed to secure for them both food and peasant
      clothing, and aided them to get away to the French lines to the south.
      Sixteen of these men succeeded in getting away, but one dark night in a
      furious rainstorm while she was piloting the seventeenth to a
      cross-country lane, she was detected by a sentry, who dragged both of them
      before the German lieutenant.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the examination before the Commandant at headquarters she defiantly
      confessed to having aided the French soldiers to escape, crying out, "Yes,
      I did it for France, and I shall do it again and again, if I am able. Do
      with me what you will. I am an orphan, I have but one mother, France! For
      her, my life!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Commandant promptly sentenced her to be shot. She was taken out of the
      room into the courtyard, where they placed her against the wall facing the
      firing squad, her arms tied behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly French artillery opened upon the German lines at Eclusier. Before
      the officer could give the word to fire upon the brave girl, a shell fell
      in the courtyard, and in the confusion, wonderful to relate, she escaped.
      While she had been assisting her fellow countrymen to escape the French
      had crept up, and routed the invaders from their position in the little
      town.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Marcelle once more fled to the subterranean passage, and there took up
      her quarters, rendering great service to the army, through her knowledge
      of the surrounding country.
    </p>
    <p>
      Between the lines of the opposing armies lay the river Somme, which here
      in the vicinity of Eclusier and Frise spreads out into a pond with marshy
      banks, and innumerable pitfalls and bogs. In these the soldiers frequently
      lost their way, and here Marcelle found a way to help France by her
      knowledge of the safe paths. Again and again she faced death; finally she
      was captured while leading a squad of men across the bogs to a trench at
      Frise. She was brought by the Germans to the village of Frise, and there
      confined in the parish church, now, alas, a mass of ruin. Once more her
      never departing good fortune was her salvation. Almost before the door of
      her prison was fastened upon her, the French artillery began a lively
      bombardment of Frise. One of the shells blew a great hole in the wall of
      the little church, and out of this hole, unperceived by her captors,
      Marcelle escaped, over the marshes and through the tangled roads into the
      French lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      Enabled to give most valuable information as to the numbers and guns of
      the enemy, Marcelle's fame soon spread through the ranks. She was
      mentioned in the dispatches, and received the Cross of the Legion of
      Honor, and later, before the drawn up soldiers of the corps, she received
      the War Cross.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was so useful in this region of the Somme that she asked to be allowed
      to remain at Frise to work for France, and so for a year and a half,
      despite the turn of the war, she stayed on, taking care of the wounded
      men, and protecting as far as possible women and children.
    </p>
    <p>
      So beloved did she become that an English general ordered his soldiers to
      salute her on passing, and to refrain from addressing her unless she
      required it. Everywhere she went the soldiers both admired and honored
      this young girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      The loss of her brothers, who died fighting for France, and the strain of
      her work told upon her health, and the doctors ordered her to Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here she asked to be allowed to work at the nurses' school and to aid the
      wounded soldiers. To this the authorities assented, as she was thus
      enabled to earn a livelihood, for all that she had was lost at Eclusier
      when the mill was destroyed. In the great hall of the Sorbonne at Paris, a
      short time ago Deputy Klotz (of the Somme) eulogizing this young girl,
      suddenly stretched out his arms in dramatic gesture, electrifying the
      great audience with these words:
    </p>
    <p>
      "This little heroine of Picardy, this admirable girl; this incarnation of
      the qualities of the women of France; this girl of simple origin, flawless
      dignity, of serious mind and gentle ways; this girl of indomitable will
      power is here, ladies and gentlemen, here among you, in this room!
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I feel that I am the spokesman for every one of you when I now extend
      to her the expression of our respect, our gratitude, our admiration!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The vast audience, every man and woman of them, leaped to their feet, in
      enthusiasm, craning their necks to catch a glimpse of the heroine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the great Hall of the Sorbonne, where the most famous men of the
      world had been honored by France, swept a storm of cheers; a reward more
      splendid than the Cross of the Legion of Honor, than the War Cross, than
      the salutes of the soldiers at the front, had come to Marcelle Semmer, of
      Eclusier.

    <h2>
      LÂON
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>OST travelers from
      Paris to Geneva will recall the brief stop of the train at the station,
      and a glimpse perhaps of the gaunt gray towers on the top of the great
      hill against the evening sky, looking much more like a fortress than a
      cathedral from the viewpoint below.
    </p>
    <p>
      Called the "Rock of Lâon," it was in ancient days the Celtic Laudunam, and
      was known to the Romans as Lug-dunam Clavatum.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lâon is the very pride of that class of town which out of Gaulish hill
      forts grew into Roman and Mediaeval cities. None stands so proudly on its
      height; none has kept its ancient character so little changed to our own
      day" (says Marshall). It was here that Louis, or Lodo-wig, who was the
      famous son of Count Eudes, established an illustrious court, presided over
      by the "brave" Duchess Gerberga, and here afterwards Charles, their son,
      maintained a successfully defended siege against the onslaught by Hugues
      Capet on this stronghold. The treachery of Asceline the Bishop resulted in
      the capture of the town, and as a reward, Capet made him "the second
      Ecclesiastical Peer of France."
    </p>
    <p>
      Henceforth the city was famed as the seat of the Capetian dynasty, whose
      bishops ruled it until it was captured by the Prussians in 1814, when it
      served as the headquarters of Blucher, in his operations against Napoleon
      I. After the Battle of Waterloo the French troops attempted to reform
      their shattered lines under its walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lâon was the birthplace of the mother of Charlemagne, Lothaire, Louis IV,
      and Louis V.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crowning royally the great hill which dominated the town and the plain,
      the remarkable Cathedral of Notre Dame with its many beautiful towers
      formed a picturesque feature that once seen could not be forgotten. One
      can only compare it to the towers of Mont St. Michel of La Manche, with
      its encircling battlemented walls, but Lâon in point of architecture was
      infinitely the finer of the two.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is said to have been the work of Bishop Gauthier II (de Montagne) of
      the twelfth century, and built upon the site of a previous structure which
      had been burnt during an uprising in the early part of that century.
      Originally there were four great towers, one at each of the angles. Of
      these two remained lacking the spires. The façade was most remarkable for
      its extremely deep portals. The two towers, which were square at the base,
      terminated in octagonal belfries, and the angle buttresses supported light
      two-storied open-work turrets of most graceful design.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cathedral was remarkable for the square apse, and there was a tall
      lanthorn tower in the center of the church, which had two windows
      separated by buttresses.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the "chevet" a rose window was placed above three long openings, over
      which was a gallery between the turrets.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pulpit was from the Abbey of Val-St.-Pierre.
    </p>
    <p>
      From below, the cathedral, as I have already said, looked more like a
      fortress surmounted by a great chateau. Strange celebrations, seemingly
      lacking in religious character, were enacted in the cathedral,
      particularly those celebrated during the month of December. "This, the
      fête des Innocents, took place in the choir, when the children, wearing
      strange costumes with copes occupied the high carved stalls and chanted
      the £ offices' of the mass with every sort of buffoonery, to the great
      delight of the people.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eight days after this comes the 'day of Fools,' during which the chaplain
      and choristers meet to elect a 'pope,' who is styled the Patriarch of
      Fools. Those who neglect to participate in this election are expected to
      pay a fine. After a procession the Patriarch is offered a repast of wine
      and bread with great solemnity, and he in turn gives to each chorister a
      present of corn in payment. The whole troop wear the most fantastic
      ornaments, and during the two following days the entire cathedral is given
      over to their buffoonery. After many cavalcades by the townspeople the
      fête terminates in a great procession of the 'rabardiaux.'" (Viollet le
      Duc.)
    </p>
    <p>
      This celebration degenerated into a simple custom of the giving wreaths of
      flowers following the celebration of mass on the Day of Epiphany.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is strange that these towns, explored by the present writer, should
      have been so neglected by the tourist. Of course, it is chiefly to the
      artist that they seemed so quaint, entrancing and profitable. No such
      exquisite arrangements of composition were found in other countries as
      here in France, and really at the doorway of Paris. Of course now and then
      there was trouble for me, because I made sketches of these charming
      localities; and even as late as 1910, when the sketches reproduced in this
      book were made, forty years after the Franco-Prussian War, when there
      seemed to be no possible danger of war in France, I was many times in
      danger of arrest for drawing a church or an old wall. Several times my
      portfolio had been seized by officers at the frontier towns, and I had
      been "detained" with more or less brusqueness until the superior officer
      could be summoned, but I must say that these occasions usually ended by
      profuse apologies on the part of M. le Commissaire, who deplored the
      activity of his men and offered his cigarette case most graciously,
      begging that I should forget the incident and wishing me "good luck." But
      it is perhaps now unnecessary to warn the artist abroad to keep away from
      fortifications, or to carry his passports with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lâon to-day is hidden behind a heavy black curtain of smoke from the great
      guns of the Germans. What has been the fate of that old gray town is
      problematical. It is said that the Germans have shot away the two great
      towers of the beloved old cathedral, and that the walls of the picturesque
      plateau upon which it rested have been razed. Beyond this nothing has been
      disclosed for the two years during which the invader has occupied it.
      Northeast of the cathedral was the thirteenth century Bishopric, used for
      a long time as the Hall of Justice. It was erected by Bishop Garnier in
      1242. It was a rather dismal looking structure, and altogether lacking in
      architectural distinction. Whatever it may have been in former days, I
      ventured to say as much to an advocate with whom I chanced to converse at
      the table d'hôte, and I shall not soon forget the reproof my criticism
      called down upon me. I learned thereafter to govern my tongue, whatever my
      convictions. The Lâonaise bitterly resented adverse criticism of any one
      of their beloved monuments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Along the edge of the hill below there were unusually delightful
      promenades, shaded here and there by thick heavy foliage, through which
      charming vistas appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      The long street on the ridge of the embattlemented hill wound along most
      delightfully, bringing the wanderer to the old church of St. Martin at the
      edge of the town. This, it is said, was once the appanage of a
      Premonstratensian Abbey of the twelfth century. It had two bays and a
      transept, and six small chapels of unique character. According to legend,
      the first bay was built to enclose the tomb of a Sire de Coucy, its
      benefactor. This Sire de Coucy had been excommunicated by the clergy, and
      being thus outside the pale of religion, he had been buried without
      ceremony outside the west door. This caused such remonstrance upon the
      part of the people, who loved him well for his great charities, if not for
      his sins, that the clergy relented, and it was necessary to enlarge the
      bay to accommodate his grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      The twin towers from the last bay are of the thirteenth century. Near the
      entrance were a number of tombs, some of them of remarkable richness of
      design, notably that of Jeanne de Flandre, widow of Enguerrand IV, Sire de
      Coucy, Abbess of Saviour-sous-Lâon in the fourteenth century, and said to
      have been the work of the Flemish sculptor, Pierre de Puez. If this work
      of art has been destroyed as reported, another unnecessary crime is added
      to the list.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was also the low relief figure of a knight in armor, evidently of
      the greatest antiquity, although it was dated twelve hundred and
      something, the first two figures being barely discernible.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ancient suburb of Vaux has been under bombardment for more than two
      years. Little is known to us of the extent of the damage it has suffered,
      but I remember a lovely old church of the eleventh century, with a most
      beautiful old choir of a little later period, where the old priest, who
      was considerable of an antiquary, by the way, showed me a fragment of
      tapestry, done in silk and wool, and of considerable value, as a specimen
      of workmanship. He plainly was anxious that I should admire it, and to
      oblige him I did so. He showed me also his books, some with good bindings,
      others worn by use. He seemed an innocent sort of man and lonely for
      companionship, telling me with simple dignity of his daily life in the
      quiet parish and the details of his office.
    </p>
    <p>
      The highest pay of a parish priest, he said, was fifteen hundred francs a
      year ($300); the lowest, eight hundred, of course in addition to his
      living quarters. He eked out his scanty income by the fees paid him at
      weddings, christenings, and burials. When I told him of the sums paid in
      America to ministers, his eyes bulged and his under lip bulged comically.
      Then he wagged his head, lifted his arms, shoulders and eyebrows, sighed
      heavily, and changed the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor old fellow, I wonder what has become of him in these terrible days.
      When I left him I gave him a pencil sketch of his church which I had made,
      embowered in heavy trees, as a souvenir. I neglected to make another, so I
      cannot picture it here, in this chapter, to my great regret.

      Perhaps the greatest, or at any rate the most indefensible piece of
      vandalism perpetrated by the retiring armies of the invader, was the total
      annihilation of the great castle of Coucy-le-Château in March of this
      year. Coucy castle, legend says, was built upon the site given to St. Remi
      by Clovis, in the fulfillment of a condition that the former should walk
      around it while the King enjoyed his noonday siesta. Afterwards it was
      part of the property of the Chapter of Rheims for upwards of two hundred
      years. In the year nine hundred and twenty-nine King Charles the Simple
      was imprisoned in its donjon by Herbert, Count of Vermandois. Enguerrand
      I, founder of the house of Coucy, received the castle in fief from the
      Archbishop of Rheims, and from it departed with his knights in quest of
      the Holy Grail and was distinguished in the Crusades. His descendant,
      Enguerrand III, who was surnamed the Great, rebuilt the castle, and when
      he flouted the authority of the Chapter of Rheims, and they laid the
      matter before the king, he answered with the words: "Je ne puis faire
      autre chose pour vous que de priere le Sire de Coucy de ne point vous
      inquiéter." In the subsequent quarrel with the Chapter of Lâon,
      Enguer-rand at the head of his cohort stormed the Cathedral and carried
      off the dean a prisoner to Coucy, where he languished at the pleasure of
      the fiery knight.
    </p>
    <p>
      The laws he promulgated and forced upon the barony were called "Le Coutume
      de Coucy."
    </p>
    <p>
      The battle of Bouvignes, in which he performed many acts of prowess and
      valor, and also his successes during the Albigensian war of 1209 added to
      his great fame as a warrior and caused the league of nobles to propose the
      dethronement of Louis IX, then a child, whose crown they offered to
      Enguerrand.
    </p>
    <p>
      So proud were his descendants that they abandoned their other titles and
      called themselves simple "de Coucy" and adopted the motto "Roi ne suys&mdash;ne
      prince, ne duc, ne compte aussi&mdash;je suys le Sire de Coucy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Descendants sold the Château, as it was called, and Jie Seigneurie de
      Coucy to Louis d'Orléans in 1400, who made it a duchy, and so amplified
      and decorated it that it became noteworthy throughout the realm. In 1411
      it was besieged and captured by the royal army, and retained until 1419,
      when it was taken by the troops of the Duke of Orleans. In 1423 it was
      captured by the English, and again in 1652 by the royal army and
      dismantled by order of Mazarin. At the outbreak it was an "historical
      monument" kept up by the state as a museum.
    </p>
    <p>
      Coucy-le-Chateau was one of the greatest and most splendid relics of the
      thirteenth century. Nothing remains of it now. It has been utterly blasted
      away from the foundations. On the heights is only a series of great piles
      of crumpled masonry and pulverized rock. The oldest, the strongest, the
      largest and most historic of the castles of Europe is now only a memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      So enraged were the French at this piece of wanton destruction, that they
      refused to bombard the ruins, even though they knew that the invader had
      intrenched machine gunners behind and beneath it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead the infantry, unsupported by artillery, charged across a plain
      swept by gun fire and wrested the sacred ruin from the enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      So terrific was the assault that the Germans could make no counter attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before they left the Germans boasted to the French villagers that more
      than thirty tons of explosives were used to destroy the castle. So great
      was the explosion, the peasants who witnessed it from a distance report
      that the great round tower, visible for miles around, seemed to rise in
      its vast bulk from the foundations, and slowly vanish in a cloud of
      whitish smoke. So fell Coucy. Another crime added to the already long list
      against the invader.
    </p>
    <p>
      The official explanation for its destruction coming from Berlin, is that
      "the Castle was not worth more than the life of one German soldier, and
      there are plenty of other such castles in southern Germany."
    </p>
    <p>
      The best view of the great chateau was that from the approach from the
      town of Lâon. My sketch shows the ruin in springtime, its battlements
      rising from the trees at its base, its magnificent pinkish gray mass
      against a sky of heavy white cumulous cloud just after a gentle rain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The small town nestled below it, and still had some vestiges of the old
      walls that formerly protected it.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a small inn bearing the grandiose title: "Hotel des Trois
      Empereurs," whose landlady cooked for us the best omelette we ever tasted,
      and begged us to take her daughter to America with us as "maid for
      Madame." The daughter we never saw, by the way. She had gone to Lâon for
      the day and we left on the afternoon train before she returned, to the
      great chagrin of Madame.
    </p>
    <p>
      My sketch shows the château on the end of a promontory. This was
      approached by a steep and narrow roadway. The great outer court was of
      irregular form, with what is styled a "curtain wall," of remarkable
      thickness; more than twenty feet, authorities claim. Beneath it was a
      subterranean passageway, "so arranged as to be mine proof" (Viollet le
      Duc). The wall was supported by ten remarkable towers, three of them
      circular in form. There was a great dry moat between this wall and the
      keep proper, paved with rounded stones, and there was a drawbridge lifted
      by heavy chains which completely shut off the inner court of the castle
      when lifted. On the arch of the great portal over this drawbridge was a
      rude sculptured scene depicting a combat between one of the "Sires of
      Coucy" and a lion which, according to legend, took place in the nearby
      wood of Prémontré. Near it was a sort of stone table supported by three
      couchant lions upon which stood a lion passant. Here each year, according
      to a pretty custom, a young girl of the peasant class gave cakes and
      flowers to the townspeople, after which there was a parade by the local
      fire company, and in the evening a "retraite aux flambeaux," in which the
      young men carried lighted torches through the town, headed by a drum and
      fife.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tower of the chateau was more than one hundred and fifty feet high and
      three hundred feet in circumference. In the drawing by Viollet le Duc it
      is shown surmounted by a conical roof, and this must have made it quite
      two hundred feet in height.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The interior was divided into three floors, once covered by ribbed
      vaulting, which has now perished. The upper floors and the platform at the
      top were reached by a winding staircase in the thickness of the wall. In
      the center of each vault was an opening through which men in armor could
      be let down quickly. The two lower floors were apparently used for the
      arms and provisions of the garrison." (Hare's "Northeastern France.")
    </p>
    <p>
      The donjon, according to Viollet le Duc, was the finest specimen in Europe
      of mediaeval military architecture.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Compared with this giant," he says, "the largest towers known appear mere
      spindles." So vanished from the face of the earth a great architectural
      treasure destroyed simply for revenge.

      RHEIMS

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>NSTEAD of being in
      appearance "a most venerable and aged town," as one might be led to expect
      from the accounts in the various guides, Rheims, or Reims (so variously
      spelled) was (1910) nothing of the sort. Situated on the right bank of the
      river Vesle in the midst of a vast plain encompassed by vine-clad hills, a
      most ideal setting, it was the busy and chief center of the champagne
      trade, and also otherwise occupied in the manufacture of both woolen and
      other fabrics. Until recently one of the most picturesque towns in France,
      it was intersected by wide and handsome streets reminding one of the
      Parisian boulevards, which although convenient gave it quite another
      character. And this "Haussmanization" (if one may so style it) did away
      with its former quaint mediævalness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Formerly there was an ideally artistic approach to the great cathedral of
      "Notre Dame," in a quaint narrow street lined with strangely gabled houses
      and small shops shown in my sketch, but these have been demolished, and a
      wide straight street, lined with characterless buildings, now forms a very
      commonplace frame to hold one's first view of this noble and magnificent
      structure, the master work of the architects Rob. de Coucy and J.
      d'Orbais, which Fergusson justly names and qualifies as "perhaps the most
      beautiful structure produced in the middle ages." Far down this
      commonplace street one could see the exquisite recessed portals (there are
      three), with its rows of saints, surmounted by the great rose window,
      nearly forty feet in circumference, and above the forty-two exquisite
      lancets, each containing a colossal figure representing the Baptism of
      Clovis, and the Kings of France. All detail softened by distance, like
      unto carved tracery upon a jewel casket.
    </p>
    <p>
      The three portals, so exquisitely recessed, were adorned with some five
      hundred and fifty statues of various sizes, some of them of great
      antiquity, and many of them on close inspection proving to be much worn by
      the action of the elements, or having suffered mutilation in the wars.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without entering into a tiresome architectural description, which would be
      out of place in these pages, one may call attention to some of the
      remarkable details of the façade above the three portals pierced by large
      windows, which was so lavishly decorated with sculpture; to the left,
      Christ in the garb of a pilgrim; to the right, the Virgin, and the
      Apostles, David and Saul; and Goliath.

      The twin towers, more than two hundred and fifty feet high, which were
      without spires, were none the less impressive. The north portal contained
      statues of the Bishops of Rheims from Clovis down, and there was here a
      doorway walled up containing a Gothic tympanum of the Last Judgment, the
      figures of which, however, with the exception of the Christ, were greatly
      mutilated.
    </p>
    <p>
      History states that Rheims was known at the time of the Roman invasion as
      <i>Durocortorum</i>. Briefly, about the year 352 a. d. the worthy SS.
      Sixte and Sinice came here to preach Christianity, and converted the
      consul Jovinus, whose cenotaph is in the archevêché. The Vandals arrived
      forty years later, and captured the town, murdering St. Nicaise on the
      very steps of the cathedral which he had founded. The See of Rheims was
      occupied for seventy-five years after the Conquest of Champagne, by
      Clovis, by St. Remi, or Remigius, who was already a bishop at the age of
      twenty-two. He it was who baptised Clovis in the cathedral, which act gave
      such renown to the place that thereafter the kings came to be consecrated
      with the oil, which according to tradition was brought by a snow white
      dove in a holy phial (ampoule) for the baptism of the first Christian
      king, and was thereafter preserved in the Abbey of St. Remi.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rheims was taken in 563 by Chilperic, and in 720 by Charles Martel,
      despite the great courage and resistance by the Bishop, St. Rigobert, who
      was exiled. Here took place, too, the interview of Pope Stephen III and
      Pepin, and Charlemagne and Leo III. Also the coronation of Louis le
      Debonnaire by Stephen IV in 816.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the following years the Archbishops of Rheims became world famous, for
      instance the Scholar Hincmar, and Gerbert, who was afterwards Pope
      Sylvester II, and who as a simple monk under the great Adalbéron attained
      great celebrity for his lectures.
    </p>
    <p>
      Until the fourteenth century Archbishops had temporal power over Rheims,
      coining their money and ruling as sovereigns.
    </p>
    <p>
      Calixtus II in 1119 held here a council to excommunicate the Emperor,
      Henry V.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1429 Rheims was delivered from the English yoke by Jeanne d'Arc, who
      personally gave the keys of the town to Charles VII and assisted at his
      coronation in the Cathedral.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lubke, writing of the sculptural details of the Cathedral, says, "All the
      dignity and grace of the style here reaches a truly classical expression.
      Nevertheless, even here, in one of the master works of the time, we find a
      great variety in the mode of treatment. There are heavy stunted statues
      with clumsy heads and vacant expression, like the earlier works of
      Chartres; others are of the most refined beauty, full of nobility and
      tenderness, graceful in proportion, and with drapery which falls in
      stately folds, free in movement and with a gentle loveliness or sublime
      dignity of expression; others again are exaggerated in height, awkward in
      proportion, caricatured in expression, and affected in attitude."

      Strange that Lubke could not realize that the sculptor produced these
      contrasts with design, so that the ugly and grotesque of some might make
      the grace and beauty of the others the more telling; but such is the
      quality of the Teutonic mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he has written so appreciatively of the beauties of the figures, that
      we can overlook his shortcomings. He further says, "That different hands
      were employed on the same portal (the North Transept) may be seen in the
      forty-two small seated figures of bishops, saints and kings, which in
      three rows fill the hollows of the archi-volts. They are one and all of
      enchanting beauty, grace, and dignity; the little heads delightful; the
      attitudes most varied; the drapery nobly arranged, and so varied in
      conception that it would be impossible to conceive more ingenious
      variations."
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the smaller portal which contained the beautiful figure of Christ in
      benediction, known as the "<i>Beau Dieu</i>," he says: "This is a work of
      such beauty that it may be considered <i>the most solemn plastic creation
      of its time</i>. It shows perfect understanding and admirable execution of
      the whole form in its faultless proportions, and moreover there is such
      majesty in the mild, calm expression of the head, over which the hair
      falls in soft waves, that the divine seriousness of the sublime Teacher
      seems glorified by the truest grace. The right hand is uplifted, and the
      three forefingers stretched out; the left hand holds the orb, and, at the
      same time the mantle, which is drawn across the figure, and the noble
      folds of which are produced by the advancing position of the right foot.
      The following of nature in this masterly figure is in all its details so
      perfect that not merely the nails of the fingers, but the structure of the
      joints is characterized in the finest manner."
    </p>
    <p>
      Two years ago it was ablaze with all this sculptural splendor. Now the
      picture is replaced by a gray monotone of fire-swept portals empty of
      tracery; of gaping, blackened lancet window-panes destitute of glass; its
      perfectly designed Gothic arches laced with fantastically bent iron bars,
      and its nave buried in pulverized calcined heaps of ashes from which
      protrude here and there blackened, charred beams, while scattered about
      are the broken fragments of the great bronze bells which once pealed out
      pæons of sound in celebration of imperial coronations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although many have attempted the task, it is difficult if not impossible
      to analyze Rheims, or even adequately to describe its vital exquisite
      quality, its stimulating originality, or to explain clearly the well nigh
      incredible competence, beauty and delicacy of even its minor details. One
      may dwell upon the glory of its sculpture in pages of description, which
      fail to picture it. Rheims Cathedral was what may be styled a great
      consistency, that placed it quite in a category by itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was quite completely without a fault.
    </p>
    <p>
      All other cathedrals of France form a chronicle of splendor. They record
      changing epochs, times, and architectural impulse. The varying
      personalities of their great designers were wrought out in their details;
      they present the thoughts of many men, each expressing his highest thought
      and ideals, and the result is magnificent agglomeration, covering many
      years of work. With Rheims however, which was begun in 1211, the case is
      different. For it was finished within the same century, to be exact, in
      fifty years, and in perfect accordance with the original plan and
      conception. To say that its sculpture ranked with that of ancient Greece
      does not magnify its importance. To urge that the splendor and artistry of
      its painteld glass was unrivaled, means little now, for its disappearance
      is too recent, too grievous and painful. Its eulogy must be written by an
      abler pen than mine&mdash;and in a day far hence, when time has softened
      the blow.
    </p>
    <p>
      (Paris, Jan. 10, 1917.) "Albert Dalimier, Under Secretary of Fine Arts,
      made a statement to-day regarding Rheims Cathedral, which, it has been
      reported, the Pope is anxious to have restored, having asked permission to
      this end from the German authorities."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Orders were given by the French Government for provisional repairs to the
      roofs of the Cathedral in autumn of 1914," said M. Dalimier, "but we were
      unable to begin work without an agreement with the military authorities,
      and they begged us to do nothing. They pointed out that the Cathedral was
      <i>still under German fire</i>, that from Nogent to La Bassée, where the
      batteries firing on the town were installed, everything that passed could
      be distinctly seen by the Germans, and that workmen on the Cathedral would
      therefore be sure to be observed and fired upon."
    </p>
    <p>
      The great interior was four hundred and sixty-six feet long and one
      hundred and twenty-one feet high. Both nave and transepts have aisles.
      Eight bays were in the nave, and each transept projected to the depth of a
      single bay. A triforium was above the aisles, and eight exquisite chapels
      radiated from the choir.

      The great capitals were covered with beautiful sculpture, beggaring
      description. Over the large west portal was shown the Martyrdom of St.
      Nicaise, and over the whole west wall was a multitude of small statues in
      niches ending in a display of the Massacre of the Innocents.
    </p>
    <p>
      A myriad of these statues filled the whole church. Adoring angels too
      adorned the buttresses of the choir chapels. Rich tapestries, fourteen in
      number, the gift of Robert de Lénoncourt in 1530, hung on the chapel
      walls, and there were two magnificent pieces given by Cardinal Lorraine in
      1570, called the "Tapisseries du fort roi Clovis," and others from
      Archbishop Henri de Lorraine in 1633, called the "Perpersack." Some
      Gobelins, also, designed in 1848 by Raffaelle, were hung here.
    </p>
    <p>
      The large organ was dated 1481, and designed by Oudin Hestre, and in the
      chapel of St. Jean was the thirteenth century monument of Hugues
      Libergier, the architect of St. Nicaise.. (This is buried in the ashes,
      and is said to be uninjured.)
    </p>
    <p>
      The Treasury included many reliquaries and holy objects of priceless
      value, such as the reliquary of Sanson (twelfth century); that of SS.
      Peter and Paul (fourteenth century); of the Holy Sepulcher (sixteenth
      century) which was given by the King, Henry II, at his coronation; the
      vessel of St. Ursula, given by Henry III; the Chasuble of Thomas à Becket;
      the Chalice of St. Remi; the Reliquary of St. Ampoule, and an immense
      quantity of gold and silver objects given by Charles X.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is said that this treasure was removed to Paris when Rheims was first
      threatened with destruction, and that it is therefore intact, for which we
      may be thankful, but what of the incomparable shrine which held it?
    </p>
    <p>
      More than a year and a half (1915) ago the roof was consumed by fire, and
      was held by authorities to be irreparable, but since then, perhaps daily
      the bombardment has continued mercilessly, simply to destroy what remains.
      Even the latest news from the front in France does not claim that the
      invader and iconoclast has been driven back fast enough to ensure safety
      to Rheims. In one day (April, 1917) the Germans are said to have poured
      seventy-five hundred shells into the city. Just how much of the
      incomparable fabric of the Cathedral, from which all the statuary, all the
      wonderful glass and framework have been pulverized by the blasts from the
      great shells, survives, is not known outside of the town, or is concealed
      by the authorities; but for one thing we pray fervently, and that is, that
      no so-called restoration may be attempted or allowed. Let no imitations of
      stone, glass or marble caricature its vanished glories.... Let it remain,
      we pray, the living, standing record of an infamous crime. Consumed by
      fire, soaked in blood, Rheims, which crowned and sheltered a hundred
      kings, has passed; <i>deleta est Carthago</i>.

      ST. MIHIEL
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>T the foot of a
      group of tall pointed limestone rocks, which seemed to be much higher than
      the seventy-five feet ascribed to them, nestled this most theatrical
      looking little town on the river Meuse, which winds in and out most
      charmingly through a district once covered with dense forests. All about
      were beautiful gorges between which the river rushed noisily, now
      following the base of a precipice of solid limestone, and again laving the
      roots of large trees growing luxuriantly on the slaty banks. Each of these
      valleys, each breach in the limestone wall, was overgrown with lush
      verdure, contrasting most strikingly with the dark brown or gray tones of
      the cliffs. Hereabouts small towns and hamlets, with scant room for the
      old houses and mills clinging to the steeps, thickly occupied the spaces
      between the rocks and the rushing stream.
    </p>
    <p>
      This small town of St. Mihiel, with its population of about eight thousand
      inhabitants, is said to have grown up around an ancient abbey dedicated to
      St. Michael, established here by some pious monks in the eighth century,
      but the landlord of the Hôtel du Cygne told me, with a shrug of the
      shoulders, that the abbey was not so old as all that; that M. le Père had
      informed him that the abbey had been built in the seventeenth century; the
      same year as the church; that he wished to set M. le Voyageur (myself)
      right in the matter; not that he cared how old or how new it was, but that
      he, the proprietor of the Hôtel du Cygne, was a truthful man, and no one,
      least of all, a gentleman who had made such a long journey as Monsieur the
      American from New York&mdash;"bien intendu," should receive any but the
      most truthful information from him, proprietor as he was of the Hôtel du
      Cygne. Which long speech he delivered with appropriate shrugs,
      gesticulations, and uplifted eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mine host turned out to be an interesting personality. There were many
      such in these small towns on the banks of the Meuse. He was named Camille
      Robert Joseph Laroche, and not only was he a genial and valuable
      "raconteur," but he had a saint for a forebear. According to his tale,
      which I have no reason to discredit, more than three hundred years ago his
      ancestor bequeathed the entire family patrimony to the church, which in
      gratitude therefor promptly canonized him, insomuch that he now adorns the
      galaxy at St. Matthias Roche. For this great honor and distinction, said
      mine host, all the descendants had ever since been paying, for, deprived
      of their estates, they became "hoteliers" and "négociants," their only
      wealth being the good will and esteem of the countryside. Thus I had the
      high honor at St. Mihiel of lodging at an inn kept by the scion of a
      saint.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was pleasant to arrive at this pretty hill-embosomed town when evening
      was drawing on and the stars, like unto glimmering altar tapers in a vast
      cathedral space, were shining forth one by one.
    </p>
    <p>
      I sat before the inn door upon a bench with mine host» who had lapsed into
      silence, and watched the crystal disk of the moon over the "Falaise,"
      shining, with that peculiar tint which has no name nor likeness on earth;
      that large mystic peace, the charm of a village at eventime, brooded in
      the air: Truly God is known in the breath of the still woods; a very
      frankincense.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some passing girls in groups who had come to see the arrivals by train,
      that puffing, cautiously moving train that had come from Verdun, with the
      mail, the writer, and a few "commis-voyageurs," several soldiers on leave,
      and three shovel-hatted priests lent some animation to the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each girl, chattering and laughing, was knitting industriously. Their eyes
      were bright and blue; their hair, gathered with gay ribbons into knots,
      was sunny: they seemed care-free.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great gray limestone pointed rocks stand sentry over St. Mihiel. Upon
      one stands a Calvary. There were fragmented castles round about. Each
      dominated a ridge, stretching away like a line of bulwarks for the
      nestling towns between. I found, in the days of exploration that followed
      my arrival, that facing beyond the thread of the river, an amphitheater of
      great beeches, tier upon tier, ensconced all.
    </p>
    <p>
      One might fancy a couchant lion on guard here, the old town lying snug
      between its outstretched paws, or to use another simile as if it had been
      cast down by giant hands and caught in the cleft.
    </p>
    <p>
      The town lay in somewhat the shape of a T, the head-stroke turned
      downwards on both sides; the upright formed by the long nestling town of
      the valley, the cross bar by the bowed overspread of habitations at the
      valley's mouth, one thronged crescent of river, road, and terraced
      verdancy. Just at the point of junction in the nailhead was a small
      convent garden, all scarlet, pink, white and dazzling emerald green. One
      would think this quiet, rident town, looking down upon it by morning light
      from the Calvary on the limestone pinnacle, a very sanctuary home of
      dreams. On the contrary, it was only a more or less prosaic manufacturing
      town to the inhabitants who lived among all this picturesqueness without
      realizing it. Listening from my perch at the foot of the Calvary on the
      "Falaise," I could hear the hum of looms.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the clang of the midday Angelus they stopped short for the brief hour
      of rest and repast. For a thousand years some of the old walls had lain
      much as I saw them, for St. Mihiel figures in territorial documents of a.
      d. 950. It is said that there was a time when the outstretched paws of the
      lion were joined by huge stone-turreted walls. These closed in the town
      and made a sanctuary. The Barons of St. Mihiel were greatly distinguished
      personages; they played a noble part in the Crusades. I found their
      records quaintly set forth upon tombs in archaic words, the meaning of
      which was often entirely puzzling and obscure. I made notes of these names
      and dates, but they were carelessly mislaid. Should one be curious about
      them, I doubt not that Froissart has recorded them in all their state and
      glory. St. Mihiel claimed the usual list of heroes and warriors, and her
      claim was granted without question.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old market place was graced by lime trees, and the ruined walls were
      overgrown with ivy and vine of luxuriant leafage, hiding crack and gap
      cunningly. The aged towers still cleaved to the rock by leave of the roots
      of beech and fir tree, whose spreading roots are more lenient foes to
      masonry, perhaps, than German mines. Imagine the great empty shell of the
      donjon, with a rugged façade, ivy grown and rook-haunted, a ruined
      chapel-apse with its suspended "piscina and aumbry," (thus named for me
      correctly by a scholarly architect friend, else I should not have known
      how to call them), its Gothic columns and arches; this sheer wall overhung
      the town perilously.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a story told of the old bell's tolling at the death of a child.
      Within the donjon is the remains of the well, fifty feet deep. In olden
      days a young chatelaine threw herself down this well, her child in her
      arms, to escape the brutality of the besiegers, in the fourteenth&mdash;or
      was it the thirteenth?&mdash;century. There were twin brothers who did the
      same, in some remote period, after refusing to open the gates to
      Wenceslaus, or was it Baldwin of the Iron Arm*? There was a cavern at the
      bottom where the knights-proprietors hid their gains during the sieges.
      All these and many other tales of fear, blood and bravery were told at St.
      Mihiel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some years ago, they said, a young maid drawing water from the well,
      discovered a golden bracelet at the bottom of the bucket; but beyond a few
      fragments of bone and some pieces of rusty iron that is all that has been
      discovered of treasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was said that the great hidden treasure is guarded by an immense
      serpent, which, when any one was so foolhardy as to attempt its recovery,
      blew out his candles and then devoured him at leisure. On the night before
      Maundy Thursday, at the hour of twelve, the master knight, clad all in his
      Templar's armor regalia, and bearing the scarlet cross upon his breast,
      rides the ruins with his cohort: but to no one save a true and devout
      Catholic was this vision vouchsafed, so it was said. St. Mihiel was
      unusually quaint in many ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      One did not find sheep grazing anywhere. When by some rare chance they
      were brought to town by a drover, the sensation produced was equal to that
      which might be caused by the appearance of an elephant or a camel.
      Children ran after the poor frightened dusty things, tugging at their
      wool, some trying to climb upon their backs, and the whole square was in
      an uproar. There were plenty of pigs about, and these, curiously, were in
      charge of a professional pig handler, who took them to pasture, and cared
      for them for a weekly wage. It was not uncommon on a morning ramble to
      come upon a drove of them occupying the whole road to the limit of space:
      a symphony in pink amid a cloud of dust.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little town was the residence of the great Cardinal de Retz, who is
      said to have written his memoirs here. The Rue Notre Dame, which led to
      the ancient abbey, and the church of St. Michael, had some very fine old
      fifteenth century houses, which were still (in 1910) in an excellent state
      of preservation. The great church dated in part from the seventeenth
      century, and contained a remarkable statue of the Madonna, attributed to
      Ligier Richier, a pupil of Michelangelo, who also carved the noted
      sepulchral monument of René de Châlons, Prince of Orange, in the church of
      St. Pierre at Bar-le-Duc. There was here too, a figure of a child
      surrounded by skulls, with two of which she was playing. Said to be by
      Jean Richier, this was a most beautiful piece of seventeenth century
      miniature work.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Madonna mentioned above was depicted as fainting in the arms of St.
      John, the pose being most remarkable. One of the curiosities of the old
      church was the remains of a stone rood loft, a structure said by
      architects to be very rarely met with. The ruined remains of the abbey at
      the east end of the church were found near some sort of public offices,
      which should have been cleared away so that they might be seen the better.
      In the Rue des Ingénieurs was the house of the sculptor, Ligier Richier,
      dated 1538. And in the church of St. Sepulcré was the famous tomb by this
      master, consisting of thirteen figures, showing the Virgin, Mary Cleopas
      and John, and some dice players, all of great realism and character.
    </p>
    <p>
      This whole region is filled with legend, related with such great
      circumstantial detail that one might not venture, on pain of giving
      offense, to show disbelief, no matter how fantastic the story. There was
      one curious old house which I saw in the Rue de la Vaux, which had a rude
      frieze of great animals below its roof, the effect being so singular as to
      be well nigh unbelievable. What its history or origin I was unable to
      discover. Indeed much mystery was made of it, when I inquired; much as if
      I had asked an indiscreet question. So I desisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the neighborhood were the most delightful walks and rambles, overgrown
      with verdure, leading past small farmsteads embosomed in thick forests, in
      a region filled with myth and legend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Following the course of the Meuse, dotted with small mills taking toll of
      her one by one, whose splashing mossy wheels she cheerfully spins; eddying
      here and there, bright gardens, one was led to a certain gushing fountain,
      under a shelving bay of ferny rock, and this was named "the Easter
      fountain." It would be strange indeed if a fountain in this region had not
      a story connected with it. This one was no exception, and here follows
      this story of the Easter fountain, as told by Brother Antoine of St.
      Mihiel.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the thirteenth century of our redemption Count Reni, in the castle on
      the heights, governed this region; at Commercy reigned Count Alan. A
      common sorrow bound the two to friendship: their young wives had faded in
      their first bloom. The châtelaine of Reni had left a boy of four years,
      and the Lady Elsa a girl baby at the cost of her life. This babe, sweet
      souvenir, was also named Elsa by her mourning, inconsolable father. All
      fêtes and celebrations were thenceforth banished from the two castles, the
      lords of which sought comfort only in the high and holy offices of the
      Church, and in mutual companionship. Pope Honoré, at the call of John of
      Brienne, King of Jerusalem, summoned all knights to the Holy Crusade. In
      this call the two bereft counts found the command of the Most High.
      Burying their grief in the forests of St. Mihiel, they set their affairs
      in order, gave over their domains to the care of overseers, and taking
      down shield and great cross hiked sword, ranged themselves "cap à pie"
      beneath the banner of their high and knightly leader, the Emperor
      Frederic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Reni leaves his little Elsa to the care of her godmother and the
      abbess under the protection of his faithful aged squire, Père Carol. So
      passes by the period of ten or more years, young boy and girl grow up even
      as brother and sister, ranging the paths of the scented wood, hand in
      hand; learning together the lore of God's wisdom of flower and bird, and
      with the pious help of the abbess, the wondrous stories of the lives of
      the saints in those great vellum bound, brass clasped office books of the
      altar. Occasionally to the castle comes a wandering singer, who teaches
      them in song the doughty deeds of the absent soldiers of the Cross, naming
      their fathers gloriously. To these songs the children, now grown tall in
      stature, listened with shining eyes and panting breath. Thus they dreamed
      of the brave fathers they had hardly known.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that the young Count had come almost to man's estate, the old esquire
      thought of presenting him at the Court of Rheims. It was summertime, and
      the time had come for the parting. Elsa wandered alone through the wooded
      paths of the forest. But the once loved scenes of nature had lost half
      their charm for her. To pass the time she set about acts of devotion and
      mercy; visiting the poor huts of the woodsmen, dispensing tender charities
      to their families and teaching the children to pray to the saints and the
      Holy Fathers.
    </p>
    <p>
      So passed the long months of summer and then came autumn in a blaze of red
      and golden leaves. Now the young Count, learning at the Court of Rheims
      that the two Counts were shortly expected to return from the Crusades in
      the East, returned to the castle with his retinue, and passing a small
      cottage by the roadside on the river bank, caught a glimpse of his former
      playmate and companion, on her knees, binding up the wounds of a poor
      charcoal burner, who had been injured by the fall of a tree trunk. But,
      lo: there was something in the expression of her face that was all new to
      him. Dismounting from his horse, he knelt before her, as to a saint. She
      was to him, all at once, an aureoled angel; a burning reverence overcame
      him, surging from head to foot, and he knew in that instant that for him
      time had brought its fullness to him, and that henceforth they were to be
      inseparable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Entranced, he studied her face, so different to him from those which he
      had seen at court at Rheims, exquisite as those faces were. But this one!
      Ah, now it was clear to him that he had all his life never had a soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elsa had gazed into his eyes unable to speak, her hands clasped upon her
      bosom. Now she gave a cry of gladness, but stopped all at once, for a new
      and strange quickening in her heart: Young Alan is transfigured in her
      sight, like unto St. Michael.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alan seizes her hand, he calls her his sweet flower of innocence, and so
      swears to be her loyal knight even unto death; thus they remained hand in
      hand in ecstasy, while she prayed that the blessed mother watch over them
      forever more. At the castle the pair knelt before the good abbot, and then
      the old Esquire and the Abbess joined their hands and blessed them.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the news of the Count's arrival at the coast, and young Alan's home
      coming went forth, the whole region rejoiced, the bells rang in the
      churches, and the vassals assembled to greet the young seigneur. From her
      bower in the lofty tower of the castle Elsa watched the road along the
      river. It was eventide when the sounds of approaching cavalry broke the
      stillness. Soon the great drawbridge of the castle fell with a clang of
      chains, and young Alan was clasped in the arms of the returned Crusader.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the great banquet hall, hung with flags and trophies of the chase, the
      retainers thronged to welcome and acclaim their returned lord and master.
      Great flagons and cups of wine were passed, and the vaulted stone roof
      rang with the loyal shouts of "Long live Count Alan!"
    </p>
    <p>
      But, strange to say, all was not well with Alan the Crusader. A dark cloud
      sat upon his knitted brow, and his worn thin hand bent upon the knob of
      the great chair upon which he sat. Elsa, in a very heaven between the
      joys, plied him with questions which he answered vaguely, and finally bade
      the churls to bring the torches from the walls, and gave the word of
      dismissal to the throng.
    </p>
    <p>
      Much troubled, Elsa gave her white brow to her father's kiss, bade him
      good night; and very shortly the castle was in darkness, and silent save
      for the measured tread of the sentinels on the parapet.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the following day the Abbess told Elsa that the two counts, once so
      inseparable, had for certain reasons become enemies, that the young Count
      of Bré must never more be named within the hearing of her father; and that
      henceforth she must forget her love for Alan, which now was quite
      hopeless. Broken hearted but obedient, the young girl, bathed in tears,
      spent hours before the altar upon her knees, but devoted herself to her
      father whenever he would see her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Autumn came, and brought winter in its train. Young Alan she had not seen
      since the day of his return when they met at the charcoal burner's cottage
      in the wood. The fête of Noël came in with a great snow storm. The Count
      no more went forth, nor did he attend at chapel. The abbot had admonished
      him upon one occasion&mdash;"If ye from your hearts forgive not those who&mdash;"
      whereupon the Count had struck the rail with his hand, arose, and left the
      chapel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Affairs at the other castle were quite similar, and the lord had refused
      to offer his hand in friendship to his old friend Count Alan, swearing a
      terrible oath that he would wither away unshriven ere he did such a thing.
      Thus matters stood at the two castles, and two fond hearts were breaking,
      while pride held out. As to the young Alan, he had well-nigh lost his
      reason but for the kindly and wise advice of the old Abbot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then one day the aged châtelaine lay upon her death bed, with Elsa bathed
      in tears beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Call thee thy father, child," she said, "I have much to say to him before
      I go." Of the conversation between them nothing was ever known, but a
      marked change came over the old knight, after the chatelaine had been laid
      at rest beneath the altar in the chapel. He passed the whole night before
      the Stations of the Cross, and cried aloud for mercy, striking his breast
      with both hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the morning he called Elsa and told her that he was to set out upon a
      long journey, and she begging that he allow her to accompany him he at
      length consented, and so together, with an escort, the old knight and the
      tender maiden set out through the forest.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the Holy Week of the Passion, and there were bands of pious
      pilgrims met upon the road, nearly all afoot, for that was the custom.
      Seeing this the old knight dismounted, and bidding the escort take the
      horses and return to the castle, they joined one of the processions, and
      continued on foot as far as the Calvary which was at the bend in the road
      toward St. Mihiel. Here they paused and let the procession proceed without
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was fair spring time; the fairest flowers bloomed all about them, and
      wild birds in the trees hymned the Resurrection of God. Elsa's heart sang
      in unison with the birds. She suspected the object of the old knight's
      pilgrimage.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they were near the castle of Count Alan, all at once she saw on the
      road the Count and his son, arm in arm, approaching them. When they met
      there was an instant's silence, then cried out the old knight, "Alan! I
      come to thee!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I was coming to thee to ask thy forgiveness," replied Count Alan with
      shining eyes; and they embraced, retiring arm and arm beneath the great
      beech trees, leaving Elsa and young Alan face to face. Elsa's hands were
      clasped upon her heaving bosom, her brimming eyes raised to the sky; then
      she knelt down beside the cliff in the moss, and young Alan knelt beside
      her. All at once Elsa's voice burst forth in the holy canticle,
      "Benedicite, opera Domini, Domino&mdash;fontes benedicite," and as she
      uttered the last words of the canticle, there burst forth from the
      limestone rock, just where their united tears had dropped, a tiny stream
      of crystal clear water. Soon this grew larger, bubbling forth like pearls
      into the sunlight, and making a channel for itself, flowed onward, dancing
      and leaping as for joy. And thus kneeling there at the fountain of their
      united tears the knights found them....
    </p>
    <p>
      And this is the story of the fountain of the lovers' tears at St. Mihiel,
      where broken friendships were said to be healed by one draft of the
      waters, partaken of by both be it understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      One wonders now as to the fate of St. Mihiel-on-the-Meuse; is that gray
      old church entirely destroyed by the rain of shells that has beaten upon
      it for more than two years? And what remains of the little town clustering
      against the two tall limestone peaks all clad with green verdure, where
      all was so prosperous and peaceful before the onslaught of the destroying
      legions?

      every headland of any considerable size on the banks of the winding river
      Meuse, there glowered a vine clad castle in a more or less ruinous state,
      and usually at its foot slept a farmstead, a village, or a town. Over each
      stream-laved promontory and every high hill there have been fought great
      and small battles year in, year out, through the ages since the time of
      Charlemagne. One could not wander far here in any direction without
      lighting upon some shattered monument of human passion and pride. "Here
      might reigned supreme with fantastic honor as its handmaid; at ambition's
      footstool religion and right were vassals." One stands before one of these
      shattered, time-battered castle walls, and tries perchance to picture the
      siege of old, with the crowds of iron-armed men busily sapping the walls.
      Through the ragged breaches made by the great stone-hung rams, they
      discharged into the interior by quaint cumbrous machines large stones,
      blazing bundles of fagots, and even carrion, while from the besieged
      warriors on the battlemented walls above came streams of molten lead, and
      showers of heavy iron barbed bolts. The country about during these battles
      was considerably damaged, and there must have been an appalling noise over
      it all, but somehow one cannot picture any very great carnage as a result,
      at least nothing like that which took place here at Verdun in the great
      battle of 1916, nor any such destruction of property.
    </p>
    <p>
      This town of Verdun, now upon every one's lips, was the ancient Roman
      "Verodunam" and ever has held a most important place in European affairs
      and history. Captured by Charlemagne, in the dim days of a. d. 843, it was
      divided among his three grandsons, Charles the Bald, Lothaire, and Lewis
      the German. Thus divided, the members of the Empire, Teutonic and Gallic,
      were never again united. Until the year 1552 the town, once the seat of a
      powerful bishop, remained free, and in 1648 it was formally united to
      France after the peace of Westphalia, when Austria relinquished the three
      great bishoprics of Verdun, Toul, and Metz. Verdun fell to the Prussians
      after a fierce bombardment lasting only five hours, and a story is told of
      how a bevy of fair young girls appeared in the public square before the
      Hôtel de Ville, where the conquerors were drawn up, and made
      peace-offering to them of the "bon-bons" for which, even up to the
      outbreak of the great world war, and invasion of 1914, Verdun was famous.
      These bon-bons were known locally as "Dragées."

      After the battle of Valmy, the revolutionists recaptured the town and, it
      is said, sought out these same young maidens and put them to death.
    </p>
    <p>
      The town, which was rather attractive and picturesque, stood in a sort of
      plain, on the river Meuse, which divides here into several streams. It was
      surrounded by fortifications, considered impregnable, which were planted
      with large trees, and there was a very satisfying Mediaeval gateway
      flanked by two great towers, while an attractive street called the
      "Promenade de la Digne" followed the banks of the river. The sights of the
      town, however, were very soon exhausted. If one followed the Avenue de la
      Gare, one came to the Porte St. Paul, and just beyond it the Palais de
      Justice and a large new college building. Then there was the Porte
      Chaussée, which was very old and had two fine crenelated towers. There
      were several bridges crossing the river Meuse, and along its banks a
      collection of ancient many colored houses, all so battered, bewindowed,
      and balconied, as to be quite fascinating pictorially but certainly very
      dirty and "smelly." Ranged along the water washed walls of these quaint
      houses, were many barges and washing boats, painted in charming tones of
      green and brown, and these, reflected in the water, made delightful
      pictures for the painter and snap shots for tourists.
    </p>
    <p>
      A very good regimental band played in the square once a week, and this
      formed an excuse for a promenade of the townspeople, and a social
      gathering at the small cafés, for the post prandial "bock."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a Hôtel de Ville of the seventeenth century, lacking however in
      character, in the courtyard of which were displayed some bronze cannon,
      given to Verdun by the government in recognition of its heroic resistance
      in the Franco-Prussian war of 1870. Near the cathedral were the remains of
      an ancient gate called the Porte Châtel. The Cathedral, the towers of
      which were high above the town, though lacking spires, was not
      unimpressive, but it had been so often rebuilt and changed, as to have few
      vestiges of the structure begun in the twelfth century. The two towers
      were square and topped by balustrades of little or no character. The
      buttresses of the apse were, however, of architectural value, and the apse
      had some curious and remarkable sculptures, while the triple nave was of
      noble proportions and had some Gothic vaulting.
    </p>
    <p>
      A curious bas relief representing the Assumption was shown in the
      transept; but beyond these features the Cathedral had little or nothing to
      offer, save a very beautiful fifteenth century cloister, which we nearly
      missed seeing, connecting die Cathedral with the grand séminaire.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great Citadel, renowned throughout Europe, upon which such high hopes
      centered in the beginning of the present war, and which resisted the
      efforts of the army of the Crown Prince, occupied the ancient site of the
      Abbey of St. Vannes, of the tenth century. It was so rigidly guarded that
      no one was permitted to enter it. From a roadway called the Promenade de
      la Roche one might idle away the hours appraising the picturesque valley
      of the Meuse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alost of those who visited Verdun, and stopped at "des trois Maures or du
      Cog Hardi," which were the rival hostelries, usually started to explore
      the town after "dejeuner," and brought up at the Cathedral as a finish.
      But to him who stayed awhile, and rambled about aimlessly outside the
      town, there was no end of curious beauties, of small scenic and antique
      discoveries, of quaint nooks, and groupings and surprises! all about were
      flowers and vines, and long white winding roads, past small mills
      embosomed in verdure, and wayside shrines where old women seemed rooted
      telling their beads.
    </p>
    <p>
      And night beyond the town brought her own peculiar graces, when the mazy
      ravines lay hidden in the glimmering dusk, and the lights of Verdun
      twinkled across the valley, or answered to their images in the stream.
    </p>
    <p>
      In towns of this region one was impressed with the prevalence of Colonels
      and Generals. Each hotel seemed to be provided with an officer, looking,
      too, much like all the others. They were invariably somewhat red faced and
      "puffy," bored in manner, and while slow of speech, were not mentally
      active or entertaining. Invariably, too, they were anglers, displaying in
      sporting knee breeches stockinged calves of the shape of "ten pins." They
      seemed mysterious as to their families, but were undisguisedly gallant in
      their attentions to the fair sex, and invariably headed the "table d'hôte"
      at which universal deference was accorded them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once, in a small town, I fancied that the spell was broken, and that no
      General or Colonel was in the hotel, but on the third day I learned that
      "M. le General was confined to his room with the gout." This room was on
      the floor above, and although the proprietor often assured us that "M. le
      General" would, in all probability, be able to come down on the morrow,
      and occupy his wonted seat at the head of the table, he did not come, and
      so we never saw him.
    </p>
    <p>
      All about Verdun were charming small villages, particularly along the
      river Meuse, and if one liked one could take a slow moving train, which
      went through a long black tunnel, and at length entered the valley of the
      Moselle&mdash;but that was another adventure which is not to be set down
      in this volume.

    <p>
      For this summer end of 1910, the valley of the Meuse was to us all
      sufficient. Here, while dozing among these small towns and villages,
      bordering on the vine clad river's splash and sparkle, resting by night in
      quaint clean and generally well kept inns, the world beyond became a
      figment. Curious fortresses still were to be found among these old rocks;
      and on the plateau the antiquarian, the geologist, the botanist may find
      much food for wonder and study, if they searched. But if they did, at
      least I never met them there. Should tourist by chance pass that way, it
      was by train, or swiftly speeding automobile all begoggled of eyes, and
      mummied by greatcoat, mindful only of the smoothness of the winding road,
      or the consumption of gasoline. But from all such doth Dame Nature hide
      her soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, tiring of this aloofness, one could always return to the bustle of
      Verdun, and find entertainment in the tortuous streets between the
      amorphous houses, with their aged carven doors surmounted by strange old
      trade-emblems, their overhanging gables; across the rough cobbled market
      place with the old town hall of pepperbox turret, its arcade, and its
      dusty hall where the "Échevins" held their courts of justice, and where
      the peasants chaffered their wares on market days, through the ancient
      gateways, and over the old bridges reflected in the eddying river.
    </p>
    <p>
      I like to think of Verdun, as we saw it "en fête" that late summer
      morning. The town was gay with wreaths and flags and streamers, the
      windows aflame with flowers. In the Cathedral since five o'clock there had
      been scarce space to kneel for the toll of masses unbroken at the altar.
      White clad priests came and went through the aisles. The air was tense and
      restless with murmured prayer and the incessancy of "sacring-bells." When
      the last "housel" had been taken, the last "Ite" said, thousands of people
      filled the streets, lining the narrow ways in thick serried ranks,
      crowding the doors and windows, and stretching in a double row across the
      bridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over all is a sense of waiting, as for a solemn thing about to happen, and
      this thrills the multitude. At the bridge end I could see the figure of a
      priest gesticulating, raised somewhat above the crowd, clad in a cope of
      gold and white, but I was too far away to hear his voice. Soon came a
      procession headed by a banner bearer, and I caught a glimpse of the
      scarlet of my lord the Archbishop, amid a cloud of filmy laced priestly
      cottas, and the violet surplices of chanting men, set in a great splash of
      white robes. Here and there a banner shone all red and gold, and at the
      end of the bridge was a great golden Crucifix.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here a short sermon was preached, and this being over there came a stir
      and a heave in the crowd, which fell back along the ways. Forward moved
      the cross, twelve banners escorting it; tapers of wax tall and thick
      blazed, and from upcast censers sprang misty spirals of fragrance, blue as
      the hills beyond the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      From a murmur which sweeps through the throng of people, a chant grows in
      volume until it is like the sound of a vast organ. All at once the gay
      burners, the smoking censers, and the gorgeously clad priests vanish
      around a turning in the street; the spell is broken; the crowd, before so
      orderly, swarms like bees in the hive, and here and there are couples
      dancing and jostling all unmindful of each other's proximity, but
      performing with stolid good humor. The spirit of the dance takes hold of
      the crowd, it spreads across the bridge, and sets of four, six and eight
      form in rows, holding one another at handkerchief length, eyes dancing
      with eyes to limbs' measure.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was little of passion but much of poetry in this dance, a sort of
      polka with three steps forward and two back, a serpentine swinging unison.
      Words are poor painters of the scene: like unto a moving wheatfield swept
      by two winds, or the sea surge whose oscillant ebb and flow is so
      fascinating. And so throughout the day, and far into the night the
      celebration continued, with meetings&mdash;rejoicings&mdash;and mild
      potations sacramental of reunited friendships; but not until long after
      the celebration ended and common events regained dominion over the streets
      and square, did one cease to see mentally the swinging sway of that dance,
      or hear the pounding, insistent, snarling drone on the barrel organs of
      that reiterated tune.... And this is how one likes to recall old, old
      Verdun, now so pathetically battered and shell torn, its cathedral towers
      ragged against the sky, and its Citadel dismantled.

      DOMREMY AND THE MAID
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>LIGHTING from the
      ordinary train (none other stops here apparently) at the dismal little
      stucco station at Domremy-Maxey-sur-Meuse, in a downpour of rain, we asked
      the little roly-poly <i>chef de la Gare</i>, who wore a tall red cap
      ornamented with a band of gold lace, all a size too large for his round
      bullet head:&mdash;First, could we have a conveyance to Domremy?&mdash;Secondly,
      was there an inn there?&mdash;Thirdly, did he think that we could be
      accommodated there?
    </p>
    <p>
      To the first question he returned explosively,&mdash;"No, there was no
      conveyance; there had never been a conveyance there of any sort." To the
      second: "No, there was no inn there&mdash;but there was one at
      Domremy-la-Pucelle, 'toute en face,' near the church; no great thing, you
      understand&mdash;M'sieur and Madame&mdash;but not so bad, and clean of a
      surety."
    </p>
    <p>
      To the third: "Yes, possibly; stay, as it rains torrents, I shall go over
      there and enquire for M'sieur and Madame.'Tis but a short walk for me, and
      I have the paletot which resists the rain."
    </p>
    <p>
      And go he did, in the driving rain, too; in spite of our remonstrances he
      trudged out into the rain-soaked road, and we watched him out of sight
      down the footpath leading from the station towards the river. And this is
      but one of the instances of consideration and kindness that one received
      in this charming countryside. Briefly, we were well housed at Domremy
      among the poplars, and though the sheets were damp from the rainy weather,
      a huge wood fire lighted for us by Madame at the inn soon dried them, and
      a good supper revived our spirits. Here charming days may be spent among
      the scenes filled with memories of la Pucelle.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are two villages here, besides Vaucouleurs, which equipped Jeanne
      for her campaign, and whence she set forth aided by Baudricourt, the
      Governor. The larger is Gréoulx, perhaps half a mile away. The hamlet is
      probably much as it was during the time of Jeanne; a collection of small
      low white houses on either side of the roadway, squalid and odorous from
      the dung-hill before each doorway. Here sit Madame and the children, who
      play with the chickens and droves of small pink pigs running up and down
      in every direction, and in and out of the open doors.
    </p>
    <p>
      The street now widens into a sort of "place" before the church with a
      square, pinnacled tower in which is a clock. The interior with low
      vaulting is rich with festoons of drapery, wreaths and some very ornate
      silk banners, all displayed with much taste in honor of la Pucelle, the
      sainted Jeanne. To right is a fine monument, dated fifteenth century,
      embellished with figures of Jacob and Didier Tierselin, who were the sons
      of her godmother, who, it will be remembered, was a witness in her behalf
      at the trial.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here at Domremy the maid Jeanne is regarded and honored as a saint, and
      over the altar are large paintings of her representing her mission, and
      the events. One of them is of the appearance of the Archangel to the young
      girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside the door is a bronze statue of the Maid of Orleans by E. Paul
      (1855) and farther on is a very ill-kept little square in which is a most
      absurd monument erected by some one who is nameless, in 1820. Just
      opposite a sort of court guarded from the droves of little pink pigs by an
      iron railing, is the quaint "lean to" sort of cottage in which Jeanne la
      Pucelle, called by the English Joan of Arc, was born in 1411. Above the
      arched door is displayed the emblazoned royal arms of France, together
      with those assigned to Jeanne and her family by the King, Louis XI. Above
      is a Gothic canopied niche in which is a kneeling figure of la Pucelle,
      reproduced, it is said, from the one inside the cottage, bearing the date
      of 1456. Here the principal room is the kitchen, in which, however, only
      the middle beam of the ceiling is original.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is said that the kneeling statue in armor was posed for by a niece of
      Jeanne.
    </p>
    <p>
      Behind the kitchen is a dark little closet, in which Jeanne is said to
      have slept. It is lighted by a tiny window high up in the wall, and here
      against the wall is a chest said to have been used by Jeanne.
    </p>
    <p>
      Domremy, in her honor, was, up to the time of the Revolution, exempted
      from any taxation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hill where Jeanne heard the mysterious voices is about a mile farther
      on, and a sort of basilica was being built here to mark the spot, to be
      further enriched by a statue of the Maid by Allard.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house of Jeanne was cared for by the sisters of charity who conducted
      a school and a small shop where the pilgrims bought medals and souvenirs.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other side of the railway line was a small chapel, to which it is
      said Jeanne made a pilgrimage once a week on Saturday, placing a lighted
      wax taper before the altar.

    <p>
      On the 6th of January, 1428, this young girl, the daughter of simple
      peasants, humble tillers of the soil, of good life and repute, she herself
      a good, simple, gentle girl, no idler, occupied in sewing and spinning
      with her mother, or driving afield her father's sheep, and sometimes even,
      when her father's turn came round, keeping for him the whole flock of the
      commune, was fulfilling her sixteenth year. ("Jeanne d'Arc," by M. Wallon,
      Vol. I, p. 32.) It was Joan of Arc, whom all the neighbors called
      Joannette. She was no recluse; she often went with her companions to sing
      and eat cakes beside the fountain by the gooseberry bush, under an old
      beech, which was called the fairy-tree; but dancing she did not like. She
      was constant at church, she delighted in the sound of the bells, she often
      went to confession and communion, and she blushed when her friends taxed
      her with being too religious. In 1421, when Joan was hardly nine, a band
      of Anglo-Burgundians penetrated into her country and transferred thither
      the ravages of war. The village of Domremy and the little town of
      Vaucouleurs were French and faithful to the French kingship; and Joan wept
      to see the lads of her parish returning bruised and bleeding from
      encounters with the enemy. Her relatives and neighbors were one day
      obliged to take flight, and at their return they found their houses burnt
      or devastated. Joan wondered whether it could possibly be that God
      permitted such excesses and disasters. In 1425, on a summer's day, at
      noon, she was in her father's little garden. She heard a voice calling
      her, at her father's right side, in the direction of the church, and a
      great brightness shone upon her at the same time in the same spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first she was frightened, but she recovered herself on finding that "it
      was a worthy voice"; and at the second call she perceived that it was the
      voice of angels. "I saw them with my bodily eyes," she said six years
      later to her judges at Rouen, "as plainly as I see you; when they departed
      from me I wept and would fain have had them take me with them."
    </p>
    <p>
      The apparitions came again, and exhorted her "to go to France for to
      deliver the kingdom." She became dreamy, wrapt in constant meditation. "I
      could endure no longer," said she at a later period, "and the time went
      heavily with me as with a woman in travail."
    </p>
    <p>
      She ended with telling everything to her father, who listened to her words
      anxiously at first, and afterwards wrathfully. He himself one night
      dreamed that his daughter had followed the King's men-at-arms to France,
      and from that moment he kept her under strict superintendence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I knew of your sister's going," he said to his sons, "I would bid you
      drown her; and, if you did not do it, I would drown her myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      Joan submitted: there was no leaven of pride in her sublimation, and she
      did not suppose that her intercourse with celestial voices relieved her
      from the duty of obeying her parents..
    </p>
    <p>
      Attempts were made to distract her mind. A young man who courted her was
      induced to say that he had a promise of marriage from her and claim the
      fulfillment of it. Joan went before the ecclesiastical judge, made
      affirmation that she had given no promise and without difficulty gained
      her cause. Everybody believed her and respected her.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a village hard by Domremy she had an uncle whose wife was near her
      confinement; she got herself invited to go and nurse her aunt, and
      thereupon she opened her heart to her uncle, repeating a popular saying
      which had spread indeed throughout the country:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it not said that a woman shall ruin France and a young maid restore
      it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She pressed him to take her to Vaucouleurs to Sire Robert de Baudricourt,
      captain of the bailiwick, for she wished to go to the dauphin and carry
      assistance to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her uncle gave way, and on the 13th of May, 1428, he did take her to
      Vaucouleurs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I come on behalf of my Lord," she said to Sire de Baudricourt, "to bid
      you send word to the dauphin to keep himself well in hand and not to give
      battle to his foes, for my Lord will presently give him succor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who is thy Lord?" asked Baudricourt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The King of Heaven," answered Joan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Baudricourt set her down and urged her uncle to take her back to her
      parents "with a good slap o' the face."
    </p>
    <p>
      In July, 1428, a fresh invasion of Burgundians occurred at Domremy, and
      redoubled the popular excitement there. Shortly afterwards the report
      touching the siege of Orleans arrived there. Joan, more and more
      passionately possessed with her idea, returned to Vau-couleurs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must go," said she to Sire de Baudricourt, "for to raise the siege of
      Orleans. I will go should I have to wear, off my legs to the knee."
    </p>
    <p>
      She returned to Vaucouleurs without taking leave of her parents. "Had I
      possessed," said she to her judges at Rouen, "a hundred fathers and a
      hundred mothers and had I been a king's daughter, I should have gone."
      Baudricourt, impressed without being convinced, did not oppose her
      remaining at Vaucouleurs, and sent an account of this singular young girl
      to Charles, Duke of Lorraine, at Nancy, and perhaps even, according to
      some chronicles, to the King's court.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joan lodged at Vaucouleurs in the house of a wheelwright, and passed three
      weeks there, spinning with her hostess and dividing her time between work
      and church. There was much talk in Vaucouleurs of her "visions" and her
      purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      John of Metz (also called John of Novelomport), a knight serving with de
      Baudricourt, desired to see her, and went to the wheelwright's.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you here, my dear?" he said. "Must the King be driven from his
      kingdom and we become English?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am come hither," answered Joan, "to speak to Robert de Baudricourt,
      that he may be pleased to take me or have me taken to the King; but he
      pays no heed to me or my words. However, I must be with the King before
      the middle of Lent, for none in the world, nor kings, nor dukes, nor
      daughter of Scottish king can recover the Kingdom of France; there is no
      help but in me. Assuredly I would far rather be spinning beside my poor
      mother, for this other is not my condition; but I must go and do the work
      because my Lord wills that I should do it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who is your Lord?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Lord God."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By my faith," said the Knight, seizing Joan's hands, "I will take you to
      the King, God helping. When will you set out?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rather now than to-morrow; rather to-morrow than later." Vaucouleurs was
      full of the fame and sayings of Joan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another knight, Bertrand de Poulengy, offered, as John of Metz had, to be
      her escort. Duke Charles of Lorraine wished to see her, and sent for her
      to Nancy. Old and ill as he was, he had deserted his duchess, a virtuous
      lady, and was leading anything but a regular life. He asked Joan's advice
      about his health.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have no power to cure you," she said, "but go back to your wife and
      help me in that for which God ordains me."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke ordered her the sum of four golden crowns, and she returned to
      Vaucouleurs, thinking of nothing but her departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no want of confidence and good will on the part of the
      inhabitants of Vaucouleurs in forwarding her preparations. John of Metz,
      the knight charged to accompany her, asked her if she intended to make the
      journey in her poor red rustic petticoats.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should like to don man's clothes," answered Joan. Subscriptions were
      made to give her a suitable costume. She was supplied with a horse, a coat
      of mail, a lance, a sword, the complete equipment indeed of a man-at-arms;
      and a king's messenger and an archer formed her train.
    </p>
    <p>
      Baudricourt made them swear to escort her safely, and on the 25th of
      February, 1429, he bade her farewell, and all he said was:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Away then, Joan, and come what may."
    </p>
    <p>
      Charles VII was at that time at Chinon, in Touraine. In order to reach him
      Joan had nearly a hundred and fifty leagues to go, in a country occupied
      here and there by English and Burgundians and everywhere a theater of war.
      She took eleven days to do this journey, often marching by night, and
      never giving up man's dress, disquieted by no difficulty and no danger,
      and testifying no desire for a halt save to worship God.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Could we hear mass daily," said she to her companions, "we should do
      well."
    </p>
    <p>
      They consented only twice, first at the Abbey of St. Urban, and again in
      the principal church of Auxerre. As they were full of respect though at
      the same time also of doubt toward Joan, she never had to defend herself
      against familiarities, but she had constantly to dissipate their
      disquietude touching the reality or the character of her mission.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fear nothing," she said to them; "God shows me the way I should go; for
      thereto I was born."
    </p>
    <p>
      On arriving at the village of St. Catherine-de-Fierbois, near Chinon, she
      heard three masses on the same day and had a letter written thence to the
      King to announce her coming and to ask to see him; she had gone, she said,
      a hundred and fifty leagues to come and tell him things which would be
      most useful to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charles VII and his councilors hesitated. The men of war did not like to
      believe that a little peasant girl of Lorraine was coming to bring the
      King a more effectual support than their own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, some, and the most heroic amongst them, Dunuois, La Hire,
      and Xaintrailles, were moved by what was told of this young girl. The
      letters of Sire de Bau-dricourt, though full of doubt, suffered a gleam of
      something like a serious impression to peep out; and why should not the
      King receive this young girl whom the Captain of Vaucouleurs had thought
      it a duty to send? It would soon be seen what she was and what she would
      do. The politicians and courtiers, especially the most trusted of them,
      George de la Tremoille, the King's favorite, shrugged their shoulders.
      What could be expected from the dreams of a young peasant girl of
      nineteen? Influences of a more private character and more disposed toward
      sympathy&mdash;Yolande of Arragon, for instance, Queen of Sicily, and
      mother-in-law of Charles VII, and perhaps also her daughter, the young
      queen, Mary of Anjou, were urgent for the King to reply to Joan that she
      might go to Chinon. She was authorized to do so, and on 6th March, 1429,
      she, with her comrades, arrived at the royal residence.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the very first moment two incidents occurred (says M. Wallon) still
      further to increase the curiosity of which she was the object.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quite close to Chinon some vagabonds had prepared an ambuscade for the
      purpose of despoiling her and her train. She passed close by them without
      the least obstacle. The rumor went that at her approach they were struck
      motionless, and had been unable to attempt their wicked purpose. Joan was
      rather tall, well shaped, dark, with a look of composure, animation and
      gentleness. A man-at-arms, who met her on the way, thought her pretty, and
      with an impious oath, expressed a coarse compliment. "Alas," said Joan,
      "thou blasphemest thy God, and thou art so near thy death!" He drowned
      himself, it is said, shortly after.
    </p>
    <p>
      Already popular feeling was surrounding her marvelous mission with the
      halo of instantaneous miracles.
    </p>
    <p>
      On her arrival at Chinon she first lodged with an honest family near the
      castle. For three days longer there was a deliberation in the council as
      to whether the King ought to receive her. But there was bad news from
      Orleans. There were no more troops to send thither, and there was no money
      forthcoming; the King's treasurer, it is said, had but four crowns in the
      chest. If Orleans was taken, the King would be perhaps reduced to seeking
      refuge in Spain or in Scotland. Joan promised to set Orleans free.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Orleanese themselves were clamorous for her; Dunois kept up their
      spirits with the expectation of this marvelous assistance. It was decided
      that the King should receive her. She had assigned to her for residence an
      apartment in the tower of the "Coudray," a block of quarters adjoining the
      royal mansion, and she was committed to the charge of William Bellier, an
      officer of the King's household, whose wife was a woman of great piety and
      excellent fame.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 9th of March, 1429, Joan was at last introduced into the King's
      presence by the Count of Vendôme, high steward, in the great hall on the
      first story, a portion of the wall and fireplace being still visible in
      the present day.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was evening, candle light; and nearly three hundred knights were
      present. Charles kept himself a little aloof amidst a group of warriors
      and courtiers more richly dressed than he.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to some chroniclers, Joan demanded that "she should not be
      deceived, and should have pointed out to her him to whom she was to
      speak." Others affirm that she went straight to the King, whom she had
      never seen, "accosting him humbly and simply, like a poor shepherdess,"
      says an eye-witness, and according to another account, "making the usual
      bends and reverences, as if she had been brought up at court."
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever may have been her outward behavior, "Gentle dauphin," she said to
      the King (for she did not think it right to call him king, so long as he
      had not been crowned), "my name is Joan the maid; the King of Heaven
      sendeth you word by me that you shall be anointed and crowned in the city
      of Rheims, and shall be lieutenant of the King of Heaven, who is King of
      France. It is God's pleasure that our enemies, the English, should depart
      to their own country; if they depart not, evil will come to them, and the
      kingdom is sure to continue yours."
    </p>
    <p>
      Charles was impressed without being convinced, as so many others had been
      before, or were as he was on that very day. He saw Joan again several
      times. She did not delude herself as to the doubts he still entertained.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gentle dauphin, she said one day, "why do you not believe me? I say unto
      you that God hath compassion on you, your kingdom and your people; St.
      Louis and Charlemagne are kneeling before Him making prayer for you, a
      thing which will give you to understand that you ought to believe me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Charles gave her audience on this occasion in the presence of four
      witnesses, the most trusted of his intimates, who swore to reveal nothing,
      and according to others, completely alone. "What she said to him there is
      none who knows," wrote Allan Chartier a short time after (in July, 1429)
      "but it is quite certain that he was all radiant with joy thereat, as at a
      revelation from the Holy Spirit."
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Wallon continues this fascinating and intimate account of the Maid's
      mission with most minute detail through her early triumphs and ordeal,
      down to the days of her capture, confinement at Rouen, the capital of the
      English in France, and her trial and execution in that town.
    </p>
    <p>
      She arrived (in Rouen) on the 23rd of December, 1430. On the 3rd of
      January the following year, an order from Henry VI, King of England,
      placed her in the hands of the bishop of Beauvais, Peter Cauchon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some days afterwards, Count John of Luxembourg accompanied by his brother,
      the English Chancellor, and his Esquire, the Earl of Warwick, and
      Humphrey, Earl of Stafford, the King of England's constable in France,
      entered the prison where Joan was confined.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had John of Luxembourg come out of sheer curiosity, or to relieve himself
      of certain scruples by offering Joan a chance for her life?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Joan," said he, "I am come hither to put you to ransom, and treat for the
      price of your deliverance; only give us your promise here no more to bear
      arms against us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In God's name," answered Joan, "are you making a mock of me, Captain?
      Ransom me? You have neither the will nor the power; no, you have neither."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Count persisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know well," said Joan, "that these English will put me to death; but,
      were they a hundred thousand more 'Goddams' than have already been in
      France, they shall never have the kingdom."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is to be thought of her? What is to be thought of the poor shepherd
      girl from the hills and forests of Lorraine, that like the Hebrew shepherd
      boy from the hills and forests of Judea&mdash;rose suddenly out of the
      quiet, out of the safety, out of the religious inspiration, rooted in deep
      pastoral solitudes, to a station in the van of armies, and to the more
      perilous station at the right hand of kings?
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Hebrew boy inaugurated his patriotic mission by an <i>act</i>, by a
      victorious <i>act</i>, such as no man could deny. But so did the girl of
      Lorraine, if we read her story as it was read by those who saw her
      nearest. Adverse armies bore witness to the boy as no pretender; but so
      they did to the gentle girl. Judged by the voices of all who saw them <i>from
      a station of good will</i>, both were found true and loyal to any promises
      involved in their first acts.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Enemies it was that made the difference between their subsequent
      fortunes. The boy rose to a splendor and a noon-day prosperity, both
      personal and public, that rang through the records of his people, and
      became a byword amongst his posterity for a thousand years, until the
      scepter was departing from Judah.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The poor forsaken girl, on the contrary, drank not herself from that cup
      of rest which she had secured for France. She never sang together with the
      songs that rose in her native Domremy, as echoes to the departing steps of
      the invaders. She mingled not in the festal dances at Vaucouleurs which
      celebrated in rapture the redemption of France. No! for her voice was then
      silent; no! for her feet were dust. Pure, innocent, noble-hearted girl!
      Whom, from earliest youth, ever I believed in as full of truth and
      self-sacrifice, this was amongst the strongest pledges of thy truth, that
      never once&mdash;no, not for a moment of weakness&mdash;didst thou revel
      in the vision of coronets and honor from man. Coronets for thee! Oh, no!
      Honors if they come when all is over, are for those that share thy blood.
      Daughter of Domremy, when the gratitude of thy king shall awaken, thou
      wilt be sleeping the sleep of the dead. Call her, King of France, but she
      will not hear thee. Cite her by the apparitors to come and receive a robe
      of honor, but she will be found '<i>en Contumace</i>.' When the thunders
      of universal France, as even yet may happen, shall proclaim the grandeur
      of the poor shepherd girl that gave up all for her country, thy ear, young
      shepherd girl, will have been deaf for centuries. To suffer and to do,
      that was thy portion in this life; that was thy destiny; and not for a
      moment was it hidden from thyself. Life, thou saidst, is short; and the
      sleep which is in the grave is long; let me use that life, so transitory,
      for the glory of those heavenly dreams destined to comfort the sleep which
      is long!
    </p>
    <p>
      "This pure creature&mdash;pure from every suspicion of even a visionary
      self interest; even as she was pure in senses more obvious&mdash;never
      once did this holy child, as she regarded herself, relax from her belief
      in the darkness that was traveling to meet her. She might not prefigure
      the very manner of her death; she saw not in vision the aerial altitude of
      the fiery scaffold, the spectators without end on every road pouring into
      Rouen as to a coronation, the surging smoke, the volleying flames, the
      hostile faces all around her, the pitying eye that lurked here and there
      until nature and imperishable truth broke loose from artificial restraints&mdash;these
      might not be apparent through the mists of the hurrying future. But the
      voice that called her to death, that she heard forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Great was the throne of France even in those days, and great was he that
      sat upon it; but well Joanna knew that not the throne nor he that sat upon
      it was for her; but on the contrary, that she was for them; not she by
      them, but they by her, should rise from the dust.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gorgeous were the lilies of France, and for centuries had they privilege
      to spread their beauty over land and sea, until in another century the
      wrath of God and man combined to wither them; but well Joanna knew, early
      at Domremy she had read that bitter truth, that the lilies of France would
      decorate no garland for her. Flower nor bud, bell nor blossom, would ever
      bloom for her." (Thomas De Quincey.)
    </p>
    <p>
      And now comes in this, which is perhaps the final year of the great war, a
      strange story from a small town in the Loire region near Cholet, of
      another illiterate peasant girl named Clotilde Perchaud, seemingly the
      reincarnation of Jeanne, who likewise sees visions and hears voices.
      Brought up on one of the small farms on the edge of the hamlet of
      Puy-Saint-Bonnet, this girl, now about twenty years old, since the age of
      fourteen has been of a strange personality. Instead of following the fairs
      and dancing at the village festivals like the other young girls of the
      neighborhood, Clotilde has always kept aloof, avoiding the young men who
      would offer her attentions, and devoting herself to devotions at church,
      and prayers in her squalid room in the farmhouse granary, where she had
      constructed an altar. So strange were her actions at the village school
      that the good priest advised her parents to keep her at home, as she would
      not study her lessons, but preferred to sit with clasped hands, and her
      eyes fixed in a wrapt gaze at the ceiling, to the demoralization of the
      scholars, who at length came to believe her half witted, and ceased to
      consider her. Not so, however, the elders. Soon it became known that this
      strange girl was a clairvoyant, and the more credulous consulted her as to
      future events, but these became dissatisfied because all of the girl's
      prophecies had to do with events beyond the ken of the simple folk of the
      neighborhood; with kings and heavenly hosts, with saints in armor waving
      banners and leading armies on to victory. Thus passed the life of this
      young peasant girl during the peaceful years between fourteen and twenty,
      until the great war broke out and armed hosts led by princes indeed
      invaded her unhappy land.
    </p>
    <p>
      So in the field below the red tiled roofs of her village of
      Puy-St.-Bonnet, Clotilde Perchaud erected to the Virgin a rude altar of
      field stones, which she trimmed with green boughs, and here she passed all
      her spare time, praying and seeing visions in the sky, while upon the
      horizon mighty guns boomed, and at night the flashes could plainly be
      seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon this altar became a rendezvous for the neighbors, and even for those
      of the more remote villages from which the young men had gone forth to
      fight for France, and to this young girl were brought pictures of the
      absent soldiers at the front in the trenches and written prayers for their
      safety. That she possessed some strange power was admitted by even the
      most skeptical, for her responses to those who had loved ones missing led
      to their being found in distant camps as prisoners, or wounded in
      hospitals in distant parts of the country. In some instances, it is
      reported, this strange girl was able to give the names in full of those
      long missing, and information so detailed and circumstantial as to be
      marvelous. These matters were brought to the attention of the priests, and
      were in turn reported by them to the heads of the church, finally reaching
      the ears of the Bishop of Angers, who had her brought to his palace. Here
      she confronted unabashed a conclave of priests. The Bishop is said to have
      dressed himself in the ordinary black cassock of a priest, in order to
      test the young girl's power of divination; an ordinary priest wearing the
      Bishop's robes, and being seated on the throne; but to the amazement of
      all in the room, the girl turned from him, and kneeling before the real
      Bishop, asked his blessing upon her and her mission.
    </p>
    <p>
      To him she announced, then, that a white robed angel had appeared to her
      above her altar in the fields, and to the strains of heavenly music
      charged that she had, as a pure and blameless maid, been selected to
      deliver their beloved France from the hands of the invader.
    </p>
    <p>
      She presented to the Bishop the book in which she had written the words
      spoken to her on many occasions by the "shining angel in white." This
      book, says the account from which this is taken, "is partly illegible and
      almost entirely illiterate; rudely illustrated in a sort of futurist
      style." Its contents are said to be most perplexing and wonderful.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Savants and students of religion who have examined the book assert that
      it shows a knowledge of the primal principles of theology, which indicates
      that the author has the clearest insight into the fundamentals of Roman
      Catholicism, but is apparently not gifted with the power to translate
      those ideas into fluent French. Throughout the work are passages in Latin,
      Greek and Hebrew, yet she apparently had less than the usual schooling of
      a French child."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bishop of Angers was so impressed with her attitude and her evident
      earnestness that he sent her under escort by nuns, to the
      Archbishop-Cardinal Amette at Paris. To him she demanded that she be at
      once taken to the heights of Montmartre, so that she might see the sun
      rise there over Paris. In this she was humored, and standing with the nuns
      and priests before the Basilica of the Sacred Heart on Montmartre, at
      sunrise, as the first beam shone upon the great gilded cross on the tower,
      she recited in a loud voice the vow which she had taken to deliver France
      from the invader.

      Since this, it is said no one has been allowed to talk to Clotilde, and
      she is said to be at the convent in the Avenue Victor Hugo. Here she is
      under observation of the nuns, who each send reports of her prayers and
      prophecies to the Cardinal. A correspondent who was permitted to see her
      from a distance in the convent garden, where she walked, followed at a
      distance of several paces by the nuns, describes her as a rather tall
      girl, clad in somber baggy black robes, very light of step and walking
      with her head thrown back and her eyes directed heavenward. Her carriage
      reminded him of "Genee, Pavlowa, or some other dancer," and he speaks of
      her as having "a wealth of filmy hair, which because of its fineness,
      seemed to float about her like a cloud, and only partly covered by a
      religious headgear," and he could see, too, "her hands, which are lily
      white and tiny, and tender, as those of the most pampered lady, despite
      the fact that the girl has done chores which in peace times would belong
      to men even on the French farms where the women are accustomed to labor
      long and hard."

      A strange story; but then these are strange times, and who shall say that
      this is unworthy of credence?

    <h2>
      CONCLUSION
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>ESCITIS quâ horâ
      fur veniet" (Ye know not in what hour the despoiler cometh) were the words
      of an inscription carved on the capstone of a church porch in the
      fifteenth century by a monkish stonecutter, overlooking a smiling valley
      in Picardy. That valley is now a waste place; its once populous and
      peaceful villages are in ruins; its fruitful orchards are gone; its
      murmuring streams have overflown their banks, choked with the debris of
      war. No church towers are visible, nor are there any forests left in the
      blasted expanse of shell-torn earth. The joy felt by the people of this
      ravaged land over the retreat of the invader, is turned to bitterness by
      the sight of so much wanton destruction, for they realize that this once
      peaceful smiling land, the richest region of France, is now a great desert
      waste strewn with ruins of the priceless records of her glorious
      achievements in the world of art. And this loss of these irreplaceable
      monuments is especially bitter to a people so attuned to beauty. With a
      contemptuous disregard for the accumulated animosity of the whole world,
      the Imperial high command seems bent upon leaving its hall mark upon the
      evacuated country. Acknowledging its inability to hold Rheims any longer,
      it retires its great guns to a locality from which it sends hundreds of
      shells crashing into that hapless town, and these are mainly aimed at the
      ruins of the great Cathedral. "The ruin even of ruins," cries a
      correspondent of the <i>Tribune</i>; adding, "In so many of the military
      transactions of the Hun you may perceive the hatred of humanity that
      actuates him, his longing to glut upon some personal victim the passion
      for destruction that is in his soul."
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip Gibbs, perhaps the fairest and most moderate of war correspondents,
      in describing the retreat of March, 1917, deals with the aspect of the
      country beyond the tract of shell craters, the smashed barns and country
      houses and churches, the tattered tree trunks, and great belts of barbed
      wire: "Behind the trenches are two towns and villages in which they had
      their 'rest billets,' and it is in these places that one sees the spirit
      and temper of the men whom the British are fighting.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All through this war I have tried to be fair and just to the Germans, to
      give them credit for their courage and to pity them because the terror of
      war has branded them as it has branded the British.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But during these last days I have been sickened and saddened by the
      things I have seen, because they reveal cruelty which is beyond the
      inevitable villainy of war. They have spared nothing on the way of their
      retreat. They have destroyed every village in their abandonment with
      systematic and detailed destruction. Not only in (the towns of) Bapaume
      and Péronne have they blown up or burned all the houses which were
      untouched by shell-fire, but in scores of villages they laid waste the
      cottages of poor peasants, and all their little farms, and all their
      orchards. At Bethonvillers, to name only one village out of many, I saw
      how each house was marked with a white cross before it was gutted with
      fire. The Cross of Christ was used to mark the work of the devil, for
      truly this has been the devil's work.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Even if we grant that the destruction of houses in the wake of retreat is
      the recognized cruelty of war, there are other things which I have seen
      which are not pardonable, even of that damnable code of morality. In
      Baupaume and Péronne, in Roye and Neslé and Lian-court, and all these
      places over a wide area the German soldiers not only blew out the fronts
      of houses, but with picks and axes smashed mirrors and furniture and even
      picture frames.... There is nothing left in these towns. Family portraits
      have been kicked into the débris of the gutters. The black bonnets of old
      women who lived in these houses lie in the rubbish heaps, and by some
      strange pitiful freak these are almost the only signs left of the
      inhabitants who lived here before the soldiers wrecked their houses.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The ruins of houses are pitiful to see when done deliberately even when
      shell-fire spared them in the war-zone, but worse than that is the ruin of
      women and children and living flesh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I saw that ruin to-day in Roye and Neslé. At first I was rejoiced to see
      how the inhabitants were liberated after being so long in hostile
      lines.... The women's faces were dead faces, shallow and mask-like and
      branded with the memories of great agonies. The children were white and
      thin, so thin that the cheek bones protruded, and many of them seemed to
      be idiot children. Hunger and fear had been with them too long."
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the reverse of the pictures I found, during those calm and
      beautiful summer days of 1910, in that sunny and prosperous land. Pictures
      framed with quaint customs; the simple pleasures of fête days enjoyed by a
      happy and prosperous peasantry, all unmindful of the terrible days so soon
      to come upon them. "Nescitis qua horâ fur veniet." How prophetic the
      warning words of that old monk inscribed upon the capstone of that little
      church overlooking the green plains of Picardy!
    </p>
    <p>
      And now what is left in place of the gray old churches, the quiet
      monasteries, the fruitful farms and flocks and the dense forests? Where
      now shall we look for the gleaming white walls of the turreted châteaux,
      the precious mossy towers of mediaeval ruined castles; the somnolent
      quaint towns with wandering streets filled with timbered, carved and
      strangely gabled houses of half forgotten periods; the sleepy deserted
      market places over which towered architectural treasures of town halls
      famed throughout the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where shall the artist seek the matchless châteaux gardens, which took
      centuries in the making? Where seek the still reaches of silent canals
      crossed here and there by arched stone bridges, all shaded by great trees
      casting cool shadows in midday, or the vast dim interiors of cathedrals
      marked with the skill of many ages,&mdash;filled with the aroma of
      incense, and the inspiration of centuries of prayer?
    </p>
    <p>
      "The old order changeth, giving place to new."
    </p>
    <p>
      But at least one may be thankful now to have been privileged to know and
      to have seen these wonderful and beautiful remains of that "old order."
      And this feeling of gratitude tempers somewhat one's fury at the result of
      this invasion and destruction. But one would not have these sacred remains
      disturbed; there must be no attempt at restoration of these matchless
      monuments, at the hands of well-meaning municipalities. Rheims, Arras,
      Soissons, Lâon, must be left mainly as they now lie prostrate, lasting
      memorials for future ages.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leave to Dame Nature the task of draping them with green clinging vines,
      and embossings of velvet moss. So let them remain in their solemn majesty,
      monuments to the failure of an imperial order unhampered by the love of
      mankind or the fear of God.
